	  (closes issue #13416) Reported by: yarns Tested by: murf If you
	  find this message overly verbose, relax, it's probably not meant
	  for you. This message is meant for probably only two people in
	  the whole world: me, or the poor schnook that has to maintain
	  this code because I'm either dead or unavailable at the moment.
	  This fix solves two reports, both having to do with embedding a
	  function call in a ${} construct. It was tricky because the
	  funccall syntax has parenthesis () in it. And up till now, the
	  'word' token in the flex stuff didn't allow that, because it
	  would tend to steal the LP and RP tokens. To be truthful, the
	  "word" token was the trickiest, most unstable thing in the whole
	  lexer. I was lucky it made this long without complaints. I had to
	  choose every character in the pattern with extreme care, and I
	  knew that someday I'd have to revisit it. Well, the day has come.
	  So, my brilliant idea (and I'm being modest), was to use the
	  surrounding ${} construct to make a state machine and capture
	  everything in it, no matter what it contains. But, I have to now
	  treat the word token like I did with comments, in that I turn the
	  whole thing into a state-machine sort of spec, with new contexts
	  "curlystate", "wordstate", and "brackstate". Wait a minute,
	  "brackstate"? Yes, well, it didn't take very many regression
	  tests to point out if I do this for ${} constructs, I also have
	  to do it with the $[] constructs, too. I had to create a separate
	  pcbstack2 and pcbstack3 because these constructs can occur inside
	  macro argument lists, and when we have two state machines
	  operating on the same structures we'd get problems otherwise. I
	  guess I could have stopped at pcbstack2 and had the brackstate
	  stuff share it, but it doesn't hurt to be safe. So, the pcbpush
	  and pcbpop routines also now have versions for "2" and "3". I had
	  to add the {KEYWORD} construct to the initial pattern for "word",
	  because previously word would match stuff like "default7",
	  because it was a longer match than the keyword "default". But,
	  not any more, because the word pattern only matches only one or
	  two characters now, and it will always lose. So, I made it the
	  winner again by making an optional match on any of the keywords
	  before it's normal pattern. I added another regression test to
	  make sure we don't lose this in future edits, and had to fix just
	  one regression, where it no longer reports a 'cascaded' error,
	  which I guess is a plus. I've given some thought as to whether to
	  apply these fixes to 1.4 and the 1.6.x releases, vs trunk; I
	  decided to put it in 1.4 because one of the bug reports was
	  against 1.4; and it is unexpected that AEL cannot handle this
	  situation. It actually reduced the amount of useless "cascade"
	  error messages that appeared in the regressions (by one line,
	  ehhem). There is a possible side-effect in that it does now do
	  more careful checking of what's in those ${} constructs, as far
	  as matching parens, and brackets are concerned. Some users may
	  find a an insidious problem and correct it this way. This should
	  be exceedingly rare, I hope. ........ ................

	  murf THis is a bold move for a static release fix, but I wouldn't
	  have made it if I didn't feel confident (at least a *bit*
	  confident) that it wouldn't mess everyone up. The reasoning goes
	  something like this: 1. We simply cannot do anything with CDR's
	  at the current point (in pbx.c, after the __ast_pbx_run loop).
	  It's way too late to have any affect on the CDRs. The CDR is
	  already posted and gone, and the remnants have been cleared. 2. I
	  was very much afraid that moving the running of the 'h' extension
	  down into the bridge code (where it would be now practical to do
	  it), would result in a lot more calls to the 'h' exten, so I
	  implemented it as another exten under another name, but found, to
	  my pleasant surprise, that there was a 1:1 correspondence to the
	  running of the 'h' exten in the pbx_run loop, and the new spot at
	  the end of the bridge. So, I ifdef'd out the current 'h' loop,
	  and moved it into the bridge code. The only difference I can see
	  is the stuff about the AST_PBX_KEEPALIVE, and hopefully, if this
	  is still an important decision point, I can replicate it if there
	  are complaints. To be perfectly honest, the KEEPALIVE situation
	  is not totally clear to me, and how it relates to a post-bridge
	  situation is less clear. I suspect the users will point out
	  everything in total clarity if this steps on anyone's toes! 3. I
	  temporarily swap the bridge_cdr into the channel before running
	  the 'h' exten, which makes it possible for users to edit the cdr
	  before it goes out the door. And, of course, with the
	  endbeforehexten config var set, the users can also get at the
	  billsec/duration vals. After the h exten finishes, the cdr is
	  swapped back and processing continues as normal. Please, all who
	  deal with CDR's, please test this version of Asterisk, and file
	  bug reports as appropriate! ........ I also made a little fix to
	  the app_dial's 'e' option, that is related to my updates.

	  These changes are in regards to bug 13249, where users are being
	  surprised by the changes made to the Set app in trunk/1.6.x, as

	  their AEL dialplan in the 1.4 world, and then carry it over to a
	  trunk/1.6.x installation where a "make samples" was executed, or
	  where they hand-edited the asterisk.conf file and added the
	  [compat] category with app_set = 1.6 (or higher). (this commit
	  does not totally solve 13249, at least not yet) The change
	  involves issueing a single warning while the AEL file is loading,
	  if: 1. app_set is present in the config file, and set to 1.6 or
	  higher. 2. there are double quotes in an assignment statement (eg
	  x = "hi there";) 3. the warning was not already issued. The
	  standalone app, aelparse, does not (yet) issue this warning. I'd
	  have to have it read in the asterisk.conf file, and that's a bit
	  of hassle. I'll add it if users request it, tho. ........

	  | 4 lines Fixes the dahdi restart functionality. Dahdi restart
	  allows one to restart all DAHDI channels, even if they are
	  currently in use. This is different from unloading and then
	  loading the module since unloading requires the use count to be
	  zero. Reloading the module is different in that the signalling is
	  not changed from what it was originally configured. Also, this
	  fixes not closing all the file descriptors for D-channels upon
	  module unload (which would prevent loading the module
	  afterwards). (closes issue #11017) ........ r138151 | jpeeler |

	  32 lines (closes issue #13236) Reported by: korihor Wow, this one
	  was a challenge! I regrouped and ran a new strategy for setting
	  the ~~MACRO~~ value; I set it once per extension, up near the
	  top. It is only set if there is a switch in the extension. So, I
	  had to put in a chunk of code to detect a switch in the pval
	  tree. I moved the code to insert the set of ~~exten~~ up to the
	  beginning of the gen_prios routine, instead of down in the switch
	  code. I learned that I have to push the detection of the switches
	  down into the code, so everywhere I create a new exten in
	  gen_prios, I make sure to pass onto it the values of the
	  mother_exten first, and the exten next. I had to add a couple
	  fields to the exten struct to accomplish this, in the
	  ael_structs.h file. The checked field makes it so we don't repeat
	  the switch search if it's been done. I also updated the
	  regressions. ........ ................

	  this branch was to take into account "burps" which could cause
	  jitterbuffers to misbehave. One such example is if the L option
	  to Dial() were used to inject audio into a bridged conversation
	  at regular intervals. Since the audio here was not passed through
	  the jitterbuffer, it would cause a gap in the jitterbuffer's
	  timestamps which would cause a frames to be dropped for a brief
	  period. Now ast_generic_bridge will empty and reset the
	  jitterbuffer each time it is called. This causes injected audio
	  to be handled properly. ast_generic_bridge also will empty and
	  reset the jitterbuffer if it receives an AST_CONTROL_SRCUPDATE
	  frame since the change in audio source could negatively affect
	  the jitterbuffer. All of this was made possible by adding a new
	  public API call to the abstract_jb called ast_jb_empty_and_reset.

	  I discovered that also, in the previous bug fixes and changes,
	  the cdr.conf 'unanswered' option is not being obeyed, so I fixed
	  this. And, yes, there are two 'answer' times involved in this
	  scenario, and I would agree with you, that the first answer time
	  is the time that should appear in the CDR. (the second 'answer'
	  time is the time that the bridge was begun). I made the necessary
	  adjustments, recording the first answer time into the peer cdr,
	  and then using that to override the bridge cdr's value. To get
	  the 'unanswered' CDRs to appear, I purposely output them, using
	  the dial cmd to mark them as DIALED (with a new flag), and
	  outputting them if they bear that flag, and you are in the right
	  mode. I also corrected one small mention of the Zap device to
	  equally consider the dahdi device. I heavily tested 10-sec-wait
	  macros in dial, and without the macro call; I tested hangups
	  while the macro was running vs. letting the macro complete and
	  the bridge form. Looks OK. Removed all the instrumentation and
	  debug. ........ ................

	  (closes issue #13202) Reported by: falves11 Tested by: murf
	  falves11 == The changes I introduce here seem to clear up the
	  problem for me. However, if they do not for you, please reopen
	  this bug, and we'll keep digging. The root of this problem seems
	  to be a subtle memory corruption introduced when creating an
	  extension with an empty extension name. While valgrind cannot
	  detect it outside of DEBUG_MALLOC mode, when compiled with
	  DEBUG_MALLOC, this is certain death. The code in main/features.c
	  is a puzzle to me. On the initial module load, the code is
	  attempting to add the parking extension before the features.conf
	  file has even been opened! I just wrapped the offending call with
	  an if() that will not try to add the extension if the extension
	  name is empty. THis seems to solve the corruption, and let the
	  "memory show allocations" work as one would expect. But, really,
	  adding an extension with an empty name is a seriously bad thing
	  to allow, as it will mess up all the pattern matching algorithms,
	  etc. So, I added a statement to the add_extension2 code to return
	  a -1 if this is attempted. in 1.6.0, the changes to only
	  main/pbx.c were applicable, as apparently the code added to
	  main/features by jpeeler were not included in 1.6.0. ........

	  murf OK, a few days of debugging, a bunch of instrumentation in
	  chan_sip, main/channel.c, main/pbx.c, etc. and 5 solid notebook
	  pages of notes later, I have made the small tweek necc. to get
	  the start time right on the second CDR when: A Calls B B answ. A
	  hits Xfer button on sip phone, A dials C and hits the OK button,
	  A hangs up C answers ringing phone B and C converse B and/or C
	  hangs up But does not harm the scenario where: A Calls B B answ.
	  B hits xfer button on sip phone, B dials C and hits the OK
	  button, B hangs up C answers ringing phone A and C converse A
	  and/or C hangs up The difference in start times on the second CDR
	  is because of a Masquerade on the B channel when the xfer number
	  is sent. It ends up replacing the CDR on the B channel with a
	  duplicate, which ends up getting tossed out. We keep a pointer to
	  the first CDR, and update *that* after the bridge closes. But,
	  only if the CDR has changed. I hope this change is specific
	  enough not to muck up any current CDR-based apps. In my defence,
	  I assert that the previous information was wrong, and this change
	  fixes it, and possibly other similar scenarios. I wonder if I
	  should be doing the same thing for the channel, as I did for the
	  peer, but I can't think of a scenario this might affect. I leave
	  it, then, as an exersize for the users, to find the scenario
	  where the chan's CDR changes and loses the proper start time.

	  lines This commit compensates for buggy poll(2) implementations.
	  Asterisk has, for a long time, had its own implementation of
	  poll(2) which just used the input arguments to call select(2). In
	  1.4, this internal implementation was used for Darwin systems.
	  This was removed in Asterisk trunk at some point, but it seems as
	  though this was not the right move to make. On Mac OS X, it
	  appears as though the poll used to gather CLI input does not
	  respond properly when connecting via a remote Asterisk console.
	  Reverting to the use of Asterisk's poll fixed the issue. Also,
	  there is now an option for the configure script,
	  --enable-internal-poll, which will allow for anyone to use
	  Asterisk's internal poll implementation in case they suspect that
	  their system's poll implementation is buggy. closes issue #11928)

	  Geis The 'data' field in the ast_exten struct was being 'moved'
	  from the current dialplan to the replacement dialplan. This was
	  not good, as the current dialplan could have problems in the time
	  between the change and when the new dialplan is swapped in. So, I
	  modified the merge_and_delete code to strdup the 'data' field
	  (the args to the app call), and then it's freed as normal. I
	  improved a few messages; I added code to limit the number of
	  calls to the context_merge_incls_swits_igps_other_registrars() to
	  one per context. I don't think having it called multiple times
	  per context was doing anything bad, but it was inefficient. I
	  hope this fixes the problems Mr. Geiss was noting in
	  asterisk-users, see

	  Spiraled INVITEs to work correctly within Asterisk. Prior to this
	  change, a spiraled INVITE would cause a 482 Loop Detected to be
	  sent to the caller. With this change, if a potential loop is
	  detected, the Request-URI is inspected to see if it has changed
	  from what was originally received. If pedantic mode is on, then
	  this inspection is fully RFC 3261 compliant. If pedantic mode is
	  not on, then a string comparison is used to test the equality of
	  the two R-URIs. This has been tested by using OpenSER to rewrite
	  the R-URI and send the INVITE back to Asterisk. (closes issue
	  #7403) Reported by: stephen_dredge Modified:

	  lines The most common question on the #asterisk iRC channel and
	  on mailing lists seems to be in regards to an error message when
	  retransmit fails. This is frequently misunderstood as a failure
	  of Asterisk, not a failure of the network to reach the other
	  party. This document tries to assist the Asterisk user in sorting
	  out these issues by explaining the logic and pointing at some
	  possible causes. Hopefully, we will get other questions now :-)

	  that, esoteric as it is, because the hangerupper context
	  immediately preceded the std-priv-extent macro, that the checking
	  code accidentally would fall from traversing hangerupper into the
	  std-priv-exten macro, where it would hit the hangerupper in the
	  'includes', and proceed into an infinite recursion. A small fix
	  to traverse into the statements of the context instead of the
	  context solves this issue. I also added some commented out
	  printfs for debug, which were pretty handy in the face of a dorky
	  gdb. This was a problem around since the package was first
	  written; but evidently pretty rare in turning up in the field.

	  (closes issue #12960) Reported by: mnicholson Spent most of the
	  day on this bug, and the solution was so simple. Just had to find
	  and understand the problem. The problem was, that the routine to
	  copy the existing switches, includes, and ignorepats from the old
	  context to the new one, wasn't getting called when the context is
	  already existent. (In other words, if AEL is adding a new context
	  to the mix, they get copied, but if pbx_config already defined a
	  context, then the copy wasn't happening. This made no sense, so I
	  moved the call to copy the includes & etc, no matter the case.

	  via svnmerge from https://origsvn.digium.com/svn/asterisk/trunk
	  Merging this rev from trunk to 1.6.0 was not simple. Why? Because
	  we've enhanced trunk to do a [fast] merge-and-delete operation
	  which also solved problems with contexts having entries from
	  different registrars. Fast as in the amount of time the contexts
	  are locked down. That *is* fast, but traversing the entire
	  dialplan looking for priorities to delete takes more time
	  overall. This particular fix involved pulling in those
	  enhancements from trunk, along with all the various fixes and
	  refinements made along the way. Merging all this from trunk into
	  1.6 involved: a. mergetrunk6 in the stuff from 130145; b. revert
	  all but the prop changes c. catalog all revisions to pbx.c since
	  1.6.0 was forked (at rev 105596). d. catalog all revisions to
	  pbx.c in trunk since 1.6.0 was forked, making special note of all
	  revs that were not merged into 1.6.0. e. study each rev in trunk
	  not applied to 1.6.0, and determine if it was involved in the
	  merge_and_delete enhancements in trunk. 25 commits were done in
	  1.6.0, all but one (106306) was a merge from trunk. Trunk had 22
	  additional changes, of which 7 were involved in the
	  merge_and_delete enhancements: 106757 108894 109169 116461 123358
	  130145 130297 f. Go to trunk and collect patches, one by one, of
	  the changes made by each rev across the entire source tree, using
	  svn diff -c <num> > pfile g. Apply each patch in order to 1.6.0,
	  and resolve all failures and compilation problems before
	  proceding to the next patch. h. test the stuff. i. profit!

	  by: murf (closes issue #12960) Reported by: mnicholson In this
	  'omnibus' fix, I **think** I solved both the problem in 13041,
	  where unloading pbx_ael.so caused crashes, or incomplete removal
	  of previous registrar'ed entries. And I added code to completely
	  remove all includes, switches, and ignorepats that had a matching
	  registrar entry, which should appease 12960. I also added a lot
	  of seemingly useless brackets around single statement if's, which
	  helped debug so much that I'm leaving them there. I added a
	  routine to check the correlation between the extension tree lists
	  and the hashtab tables. It can be amazingly helpful when you have
	  lots of dialplan stuff, and need to narrow down where a problem
	  is occurring. It's ifdef'd out by default. I cleaned up the code
	  around the new CIDmatch code. It was leaving hanging extens with
	  bad ptrs, getting confused over which objects to remove, etc. I
	  tightened up the code and changed the call to remove_exten in the
	  merge_and_delete code. I added more conditions to check for empty
	  context worthy of deletion. It's not empty if there are any
	  includes, switches, or ignorepats present. If I've missed
	  anything, please re-open this bug, and be prepared to supply
	  example dialplan code. ........

	  conclusion that with the use of recursive locks, none of the
	  constructs in use today are failsafe from deadlocks. Finally, it
	  makes some recommendations for new code being written. As proper

	  lines The monitor-join option for queues was deprecated in favor
	  of using MixMonitor to mix audio. However, it was pointed out to

	  variable is ignored as well. This means that people can't do
	  their own custom mixing commands at the end of recordings in
	  order to make, for instance, stereo recordings of calls. With
	  this patch, app_queue will set the "joinfiles" variable for the
	  channel's monitor if MONITOR_EXEC is not zero-length. This means
	  that for normal audio mixing, MixMonitor is still the preferred
	  choice, but we allow custom mixing to be done with the two
	  Monitor streams if desired. (closes issue #12923) Reported by:

	  (closes issue #12689) Reported by: ys Many thanks to ys for doing
	  the research on this problem. I didn't think it would be best to
	  unlock the contexts and then relock them after the
	  remove_extension2() call, so I added an extra arg to
	  remove_extension2() and set it appropriately in each call. There
	  were not that many. I considered forcing the code to lock the
	  contexts before the call to remove_extension2(), but that would
	  require a slightly greater degree of changes, especially since
	  the find_context_locked is local to pbx.c I did a simple sanity
	  test to make sure the code doesn't mess things up in general.

	  to remove some roadblocks for CDR applications. The "show
	  application ForkCDR" output was upgraded to more fully explain
	  the inner workings of forkCDR. The A option was added to forkCDR
	  to force the CDR system to NOT change the disposition on the
	  original CDR, after the fork. This involves ast_cdr_answer,
	  _busy, _failed, and so on. The T option was added to forkCDR to
	  force obedience of the cdr LOCKED flag in the ast_cdr_end, all
	  the disposition changing funcs (ast_cdr_answer, etc), and in the
	  ast_cdr_setvar func. The CHANGES file was updated to explain ALL
	  the new options added to satisfy this bug report (and some
	  requests made verbally and via email, irc, etc, over the past
	  months/year) The 's' option was added to the CDR() func, to force
	  it to skip LOCKED cdr's in the chain. Again, the new options
	  should be totally transparent to existing apps! Current behavior
	  of CDR, forkCDR, and the rest of the CDR system should not change
	  one little bit. Until you add the new options, at least! ........

	  substantially in config_text_file_load when LOW_MEMORY is turned
	  on. This change combined with the fix from revision 117462
	  (making mkintf not copy the zt_chan_conf structure) was enough to

	  entirely. I think it is not necessary to see this message. It
	  didn't state that a NoOp() was inserted automatically on your

	  writers with unnecessary warnings? The details of the

	  46 lines (closes issue #10668) (closes issue #11721) (closes
	  issue #12726) Reported by: arkadia Tested by: murf These changes:
	  1. revert the changes made via bug 10668; I should have known
	  that such changes, even tho they made sense at the time, seemed
	  like an omission, etc, were actually integral to the CDR system
	  via forkCDR. It makes sense to me now that forkCDR didn't
	  natively end any CDR's, but rather depended on natively closing
	  them all at hangup time via traversing and closing them all,
	  whether locked or not. I still don't completely understand the
	  benefits of setvar and answer operating on locked cdrs, but I've
	  seen enough to revert those changes also, and stop messing up
	  users who depended on that behavior. bug 12726 found reverting
	  the changes fixed his changes, and after a long review and
	  working on forkCDR, I can see why. 2. Apply the suggested
	  enhancements proposed in 10668, but in a completely compatible
	  way. ForkCDR will behave exactly as before, but now has new
	  options that will allow some actions to be taken that will
	  slightly modify the outcome and side-effects of forkCDR. Based on
	  conversations I've had with various people, these small tweaks
	  will allow some users to get the behavior they need. For
	  instance, users executing forkCDR in an AGI script will find the
	  answer time set, and DISPOSITION set, a situation not covered
	  when the routines were first written. 3. A small problem in the
	  cdr serializer would output answer and end times even when they
	  were not set. This is now fixed. ........ ................

	  lines Be sure that we cache included files for each source file
	  which loads a configuration file. As it was, only the first did
	  so. This led to a problem if the included file was changed (but
	  not the configuration file which includes it) and the second
	  source file attempted to reload the configuration. It would not
	  see that the included file had changed. In this particular
	  example, res_phoneprov and chan_sip both loaded sip.conf, which
	  included a file call sip.peers.conf. Since res_phoneprov was the
	  first to load sip.conf, only it cached the fact that sip.conf
	  included sip.peers.conf. If sip.peers.conf were changed and
	  sip.conf were not and a sip reload were issued (meaning that
	  chan_sip attempts to reload sip.conf only if it and its included
	  files have changed) the changes made to sip.peers.conf would not
	  be seen and therefore no action would be taken. (closes issue

	  to be a macro which maps to __ast_channel_lock(), which then
	  relays the proper file name, line number, and function name
	  information to the core lock functions so that this information
	  will be displayed in the case that there is some sort of locking

	  | 24 lines Fix a deadlock involving channel autoservice and
	  chan_local that was debugged and fixed by mmichelson and me. We
	  observed a system that had a bunch of threads stuck in
	  ast_autoservice_stop(). The reason these threads were waiting
	  around is because this function waits to ensure that the channel
	  list in the autoservice thread gets rebuilt before the stop()
	  function returns. However, the autoservice thread was also
	  locked, so the autoservice channel list was never getting
	  rebuilt. The autoservice thread was stuck waiting for the channel
	  lock on a local channel. However, the local channel was locked by
	  a thread that was stuck in the autoservice stop function. It
	  turned out that the issue came down to the local_queue_frame()
	  function in chan_local. This function assumed that one of the
	  channels passed in as an argument was locked when called.
	  However, that was not always the case. There were multiple cases
	  in which this channel was not locked when the function was
	  called. We fixed up chan_local to indicate to this function
	  whether this channel was locked or not. The previous assumption
	  had caused local_queue_frame() to improperly return with the
	  channel locked, where it would then never get unlocked. (closes

	  | 25 lines Fix a race condition that bbryant just found while
	  doing some IAX2 testing. He was running Asterisk trunk running
	  IAX2 calls through a few Asterisk boxes, however, the audio was
	  extremely choppy. We looked at a packet trace and saw a storm of
	  INVAL and VNAK frames being sent from one box to another. It
	  turned out that what had happened was that one box tried to send
	  a CONTROL frame before the 3 way handshake had completed. So,
	  that frame did not include the destination call number, because
	  it didn't have it yet. Part of our recent work for security
	  issues included an additional check to ensure that frames that
	  are supposed to include the destination call number have the
	  correct one. This caused the frame to be rejected with an INVAL.
	  The frame would get retransmitted for forever, rejected every
	  time ... This race condition exists in all versions that got the
	  security changes, in theory. However, it is really only likely
	  that this would cause a problem in Asterisk trunk. There was a
	  control frame being sent (SRCUPDATE) at the _very_ beginning of
	  the call, which does not exist in 1.2 or 1.4. However, I am
	  fixing all versions that could potentially be affected by the
	  introduced race condition. These changes are what bbryant and I
	  came up with to fix the issue. Instead of simply dropping control
	  frames that get sent before the handshake is complete, the code
	  attempts to wait a little while, since in most cases, the
	  handshake will complete very quickly. If it doesn't complete
	  after yielding for a little while, then the frame gets dropped.

	  lines #execing the same file multiple times led to warning

	  name of the #exec'd file, with the Unix timestamp and thread ID
	  concatenated. The issue was that if multiple #exec statements of

	  | 28 lines Merge changes from team/russell/iax2_find_callno and
	  iax2_find_callno_1.4 These changes address a critical performance
	  issue introduced in the latest release. The fix for the latest
	  security issue included a change that made Asterisk randomly
	  choose call numbers to make them more difficult to guess by
	  attackers. However, due to some inefficient (this is by far, an
	  understatement) code, when Asterisk chose high call numbers,
	  chan_iax2 became unusable after just a small number of calls. On
	  a small embedded platform, it would not be able to handle a
	  single call. On my Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.33 GHz, I couldn't run
	  more than about 16 IAX2 channels. Ouch. These changes address
	  some performance issues of the find_callno() function that have
	  bothered me for a very long time. On every incoming media frame,
	  it iterated through every possible call number trying to find a
	  matching active call. This involved a mutex lock and unlock for
	  each call number checked. So, if the random call number chosen
	  was 20000, then every media frame would cause 20000 locks and
	  unlocks. Previously, this problem was not as obvious since
	  Asterisk always chose the lowest call number it could. A second
	  container for IAX2 pvt structs has been added. It is an astobj2
	  hash table. When we know the remote side's call number, the pvt
	  goes into the hash table with a hash value of the remote side's
	  call number. Then, lookups for incoming media frames are a very
	  fast hash lookup instead of an absolutely insane array traversal.
	  In a quick test, I was able to get more than 3600% more IAX2
	  channels on my machine with these changes. ........

	  extension is being added in replace mode, which kinda assumes
	  that the pattern trie has been formed, when in fact, in this
	  case, it was not. The checks being done are not nec. when the
	  tree is not yet formed, as changes like this will be summarized
	  when the trie is formed in the future. I tested the fix, and the
	  crash no longer happens. Feel free to open the bug again if this

	  lines There was a subtle logical difference between 1.4 and trunk
	  with regards to how timeouts were handled. In 1.4, if the
	  absolute timeout were reached on a call, no matter what the
	  return value of ast_spawn_extension was, the pbx would attempt to
	  go to the 'T' extension or hangup otherwise. The rearrangement of
	  this function in trunk made this check only happen in the case
	  that ast_spawn_extension returned 0. If ast_spawn_extension
	  returned 1, then the fact that the timeout expired resulted in a
	  no-op, and would cause an infinite loop to occur in
	  __ast_pbx_run. This change fixes this problem. Now timeouts will
	  behave as they did in 1.4 (closes issue #11550) Reported by: pj

	  still needed, I feel that the job (at last) is somewhat
	  completed. Finally, I had a chance to comprehend how the scoring
	  of extension patterns was done in the previous version, and I've
	  come very close to using the exact same criteria in the new
	  pattern matching code. The left-right sorting is now replicated
	  in the trie structure itself, such that the first match found
	  will the 'best' match. Compared the results against 1.4 for
	  several extensions. Replicated falves11's setup and it works.
	  Used some devious patterns provided by jsmith, supplemented with
	  a few of my own. Looks good. ........

	  app_queue module. The problem was that when the refcount on the
	  queue hit 0, the destructor was called, and inside the
	  destructor, another function was called which would increase the
	  refcount back to 1 again and then decrease it again back to 0 for
	  every member in the queue. This meant that the destructor was
	  being recursively called, leading to a double free of the queue.
	  This is now fixed by making sure to unlink the queue from the
	  queues container prior to the final unref of the queue. ........

	  These changes will set a channel variable ~~EXTEN~~ just before

	  Plus, people who compile with DO_CRASH are more likely to
	  encounter a crash due to this change. While I think the usage of
	  DO_CRASH in ast_sched_del is a bit absurd, this sort of change is
	  beyond the scope of 1.4 and should be done instead in a developer
	  branch based on trunk so that all scheduler functions are fixed
	  at once. I also am reverting the change to trunk and 1.6 since
	  they also suffer from the DO_CRASH potential. (closes issue

	  wideband codec handling to get G.722 music on hold working for
	  me. (issue #12164, reported by milazzo and jsmith, patches by me)
	  res/res_musiconhold.c: - I moved a single line so that the sample
	  queue update happened before ast_write(). The reason that this
	  was a bug is that the G.722 frame originally says it has 320
	  samples in it (which is correct). However, when the frame is
	  written to a channel that uses RTP, main/rtp.c modifies the frame
	  to cut the number of samples in half before it sends it on the
	  wire. This is to account for the stupid incorrect G.722 spec that
	  makes it so we have to lie about the number of samples with RTP.
	  I should probably go and re-work the RTP code so it doesn't
	  modify the frame so that a bug like this won't happen in the
	  future. However, this change to MOH is harmless. main/channel.c:
	  - I made two fixes in regards to generator timing. Generators use
	  samples for timing. However, this code assumed 8 kHz samples. In
	  one case, it was a hard coded 160 samples, that is now written as
	  the sample rate / 50. The other place was dealing with timing a
	  generator based on frames coming from the other direction.
	  However, that would have only worked if the sample rates for the
	  formats in both directions were the same. The code now takes into
	  account that the sample rates may differ, and scales the
	  generator samples accordingly. ........

	  11442.patch uploaded by murf (license 17) Tested by: murf I
	  didn't give tzafrir very much time to test this, but if he does
	  still have remaining issues, he is welcome to re-open this bug,
	  and we'll do what is called for. I reproduced the problem, and
	  tested the fix, so I hope I am not jumping by just going ahead
	  and committing the fix. The problem was with what file_save does
	  with templates; firstly, it tended to print out multiple options:
	  [my_category](!)(templateref) instead of
	  [my_category](!,templateref) which is fixed by this patch.
	  Nextly, the code to suppress output of duplicate declarations
	  that would occur because the reader copies inherited declarations
	  down the hierarchy, was not working. Thus: [master-template](!)
	  mastervar = bar [template](!,master-template) tvar = value
	  [cat](template) catvar = val would be rewritten as: ;! ;!
	  Automatically generated configuration file ;! Filename:
	  experiment.conf (/etc/asterisk/experiment.conf) ;! Generator:
	  Manager ;! Creation Date: Tue Mar 18 23:17:46 2008 ;!
	  [master-template](!) mastervar = bar
	  [template](!,master-template) mastervar = bar tvar = value
	  [cat](template) mastervar = bar tvar = value catvar = val This
	  has been fixed. Since the config reader 'explodes' inherited vars
	  into the category, users may, in certain circumstances, see
	  output different from what they originally entered, but it should
	  be both correct and equivalent. ........ ................

	  info which is displayed via the "core show locks" command. The
	  idea behind this section of code was to remove the previous lock
	  from the list if it was a trylock that had failed. Unfortunately,
	  instead of checking the status of the previous lock, we were
	  referencing the index immediately following the previous lock in
	  the lock_info->locks array. The result of this problem, under the
	  right circumstances, was that the lock which we currently in the
	  process of attempting to acquire could "overwrite" the previous
	  lock which was acquired. While this does not in any way affect
	  typical operation, it *could* lead to misleading "core show
	  locks" output. ........ ................

	  2008) | 33 lines Fix a race condition in the SIP packet scheduler
	  which could cause a crash. chan_sip uses the scheduler API in
	  order to schedule retransmission of reliable packets (such as
	  INVITES). If a retransmission of a packet is occurring, then the
	  packet is removed from the scheduler and retrans_pkt is called.
	  Meanwhile, if a response is received from the packet as
	  previously transmitted, then when we ACK the response, we will
	  remove the packet from the scheduler and free the packet. The
	  problem is that both the ACK function and retrans_pkt attempt to
	  acquire the same lock at the beginning of the function call. This
	  means that if the ACK function acquires the lock first, then it
	  will free the packet which retrans_pkt is about to read from and
	  write to. The result is a crash. The solution: 1. If the ACK
	  function fails to remove the packet from the scheduler and the
	  retransmit id of the packet is not -1 (meaning that we have not
	  reached the maximum number of retransmissions) then release the
	  lock and yield so that retrans_pkt may acquire the lock and
	  operate. 2. Make absolutely certain that the ACK function does
	  not recursively lock the lock in question. If it does, then
	  releasing the lock will do no good, since retrans_pkt will still
	  be unable to acquire the lock. (closes issue #12098) Reported by:

	  because there are some perfectly legitimate places where
	  ast_sched_del may fail to delete an entry (e.g. when the
	  scheduler callback manually reschedules with a new id instead of
	  returning non-zero to tell the scheduler to reschedule with the
	  same idea). I also raised the debug level of the debug message in
	  AST_SCHED_DEL since it seems like it could come up quite
	  frequently since the macro is probably being used in several
	  places where it shouldn't be. Also removed the redundant line,
	  file, and function information since that is provided by ast_log.

	  | 40 lines (closes issue #12187, reported by atis, fixed by me
	  after some brainstorming on the issue with mmichelson) - Update
	  copyright info on app_chanspy. - Fix a race condition that caused
	  app_chanspy to crash. The issue was that the chanspy datastore
	  magic that was used to ensure that spyee channels did not
	  disappear out from under the code did not completely solve the
	  problem. It was actually possible for chanspy to acquire a
	  channel reference out of its datastore to a channel that was in
	  the middle of being destroyed. That was because datastore
	  destruction in ast_channel_free() was done near the end. So, this
	  left the code in app_chanspy accessing a channel that was
	  partially, or completely invalid because it was in the process of
	  being free'd by another thread. The following sort of shows the
	  code path where the race occurred:
	  =============================================================================
	  Thread 1 (PBX thread for spyee chan) || Thread 2 (chanspy)
	  --------------------------------------||-------------------------------------
	  ast_channel_free() || - remove channel from channel list || -

	  Merge changes from team/russell/g722-sillyness ... Fix a number
	  of other places where the number of samples in a G722 frame was
	  not properly handled because of various reasons. main/rtp.c: -
	  When a G722 frame is read from the smoother, the number of
	  samples in the frame must be divided by 2 before being sent out
	  over the network. Even though G722 is 16 kHz, an error in some
	  previous spec has made it so that we have to list the number of
	  samples such as if it was 8 kHz. main/file.c: - When scheduling
	  the next time to expect a frame, take into account that the
	  format of the file we're reading from may not be 8 kHz.
	  codecs/codec_g722.c: - When converting from G722 to slinear,
	  g722_decode() expects its samples parameter to be in the silly
	  (real samples / 2) format. Make it so. - When converting from
	  slinear to G722, properly set the number of samples in the frame
	  to be the number of bytes of output * 2. formats/format_pcm.c: -
	  This format module handles G722, among a number of other formats.
	  However, the read() and seek() functions did not account for the
	  fact that G722 has 2 samples per byte. (closes issue #12130,

	  | 24 lines Merge in some changes from
	  team/russell/autoservice-nochans-1.4 These changes fix up some
	  dubious code that I came across while auditing what happens in
	  the autoservice thread when there are no channels currently in
	  autoservice. 1) Change it so that autoservice thread doesn't keep
	  looping around calling ast_waitfor_n() on 0 channels twice a
	  second. Instead, use a thread condition so that the thread
	  properly goes to sleep and does not wake up until a channel is
	  put into autoservice. This actually fixes an interesting bug, as
	  well. If the autoservice thread is already running (almost always
	  is the case), then when the thread goes from having 0 channels to
	  have 1 channel to autoservice, that channel would have to wait
	  for up to 1/2 of a second to have the first frame read from it.
	  2) Fix up the code in ast_waitfor_nandfds() for when it gets
	  called with no channels and no fds to poll() on, such as was the
	  case with the previous code for the autoservice thread. In this
	  case, the code would call alloca(0), and pass the result as the
	  first argument to poll(). In this case, the 2nd argument to
	  poll() specified that there were no fds, so this invalid pointer
	  shouldn't actually get dereferenced, but, this code makes it
	  explicit and ensures the pointers are NULL unless we have valid
	  data to put there. (related to issue #12116) ........

	  condition in the handling of the list of channels in autoservice.
	  The problem was that it was possible for a channel to get removed

	  still messing with the channel. This led to memory corruption,
	  and caused crashes. This explains multiple backtraces I have seen
	  that have references to autoservice, but do to the nature of the
	  issue (memory corruption), could cause crashes in a number of
	  areas. (fixes the crash in BE-386) (closes issue #11694) (closes

	  | 33 lines Merge changes from team/russell/smdi-1.4 This commit
	  brings in a significant set of changes to the SMDI support in
	  Asterisk. There were a number of bugs in the current
	  implementation, most notably being that it was very likely on
	  busy systems to pop off the wrong message from the SMDI message
	  queue. So, this set of changes fixes the issues discovered as
	  well as introducing some new ways to use the SMDI support which
	  are required to avoid the bugs with grabbing the wrong message
	  off of the queue. This code introduces a new interface to SMDI,
	  with two dialplan functions. First, you get an SMDI message in
	  the dialplan using SMDI_MSG_RETRIEVE() and then you access
	  details in the message using the SMDI_MSG() function. A side
	  benefit of this is that it now supports more than just chan_zap.
	  For example, with this implementation, you can have some FXO
	  lines being terminated on a SIP gateway, but the SMDI link in
	  Asterisk. Another issue with the current implementation is that
	  it is quite common that the station ID that comes in on the SMDI
	  link is not necessarily the same as the Asterisk voicemail box.
	  There are now additional directives in the smdi.conf
	  configuration file which let you map SMDI station IDs to Asterisk
	  voicemail boxes. Yet another issue with the current SMDI support
	  was related to MWI reporting over the SMDI link. The current code
	  could only report a MWI change when the change was made by
	  someone calling into voicemail. If the change was made by some
	  other entity (such as with IMAP storage, or with a web interface
	  of some kind), then the MWI change would never be sent. The SMDI
	  module can now poll for MWI changes if configured to do so. This
	  work was inspired by and primarily done for the University of
	  Pennsylvania. (also related to issue #9260) ........

	  | 10 lines This patch fixes some pretty significant problems with
	  how app_chanspy handles pointers to channels that are being spied
	  upon. It was very likely that a crash would occur if the channel
	  being spied upon hung up. This was because the current
	  ast_channel handling _requires_ that the object is locked or else
	  it could disappear at any time (except in the owning channel
	  thread). So, this patch uses some channel datastore magic on the
	  spied upon channel to be able to detect if and when the channel
	  goes away. (closes issue #11877) (patch written by me, but thanks

	  old locks that threads failed to lock don't sit around in the
	  history. When a lock is first locked, this checks to see if the
	  last lock in the list was one that was failed to be locked. If it
	  is, then that was a lock that we're no longer sitting in a
	  trylock loop trying to lock, so just remove it. (inspired by

	  channels was not possible. During a channel masquerade, the
	  monitors on the two channels involved are swapped. In 99% of the
	  cases this results in the desired effect. However, if monitoring
	  a local channel, this caused the monitor which was on the local
	  channel to get moved onto a channel which is immediately hung up
	  after the masquerade has completed. By swapping the monitors
	  prior to the masquerade, we avoid the problem by tricking the
	  masquerade into placing the monitor back onto the channel where
	  we want it. During the investigation of the issue, the channel's
	  monitor was the only thing that was swapped in such a manner
	  which did not make sense to have done. All other variable
	  swapping made sense. ........

	* CREDITS, channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Merge the
	  changes from issue #10665 from the team/group/sip_session_timers
	  branch. This set of changes introduces SIP session timers support
	  (RFC 4028). In short, this prevents stuck SIP sessions that were
	  not properly torn down due to network or endpoint failures during
	  an established SIP session. To quote some of the documentation
	  supplied with the patch: "The SIP Session-Timers is an extension
	  of the SIP protocol that allows end-points and proxies to refresh
	  a session periodically. The sessions are kept alive by sending a
	  RE-INVITE or UPDATE request at a negotiated interval. If a
	  session refresh fails then all the entities that support Session-
	  Timers clear their internal session state. In addition, UAs
	  generate a BYE request in order to clear the state in the proxies
	  and the remote UA (this is done for the benefit of SIP entities
	  in the path that do not support Session-Timers)." (closes issue

	  related note, the usage of BUFSIZ in various places in chan_sip
	  is arbitrary and careless. BUFSIZ is a system specific define. On
	  my machine, it is 8192, but by definition (according to google)
	  could be as small as 256. So, this buffer in check_auth was 16
	  kB. We don't even support SIP messages larger than 4 kB! Further

	  Jan 2008) | 25 lines Commit a fix for some memory access errors
	  pointed out by the valgrind2.txt output on issue #11698. The
	  issue here is that it is possible for an instance of a translator
	  to get destroyed while the frame allocated as a part of the
	  translator is still being processed. Specifically, this is
	  possible anywhere between a call to ast_read() and
	  ast_frame_free(), which is _a lot_ of places in the code. The
	  reason this happens is that the channel might get masqueraded
	  during this time. During a masquerade, existing translation paths
	  get destroyed. So, this patch fixes the issue in an API and ABI
	  compatible way. (This one is for you, paravoid!) It changes an
	  int in ast_frame to be used as flag bits. The 1 bit is still used
	  to indicate that the frame contains timing information. Also, a
	  second flag has been added to indicate that the frame came from a
	  translator. When a frame with this flag gets released and has
	  this flag, a function is called in translate.c to let it know
	  that this frame is doing being processed. At this point, the flag
	  gets cleared. Also, if the translator was requested to be
	  destroyed while its internal frame still had this flag set, its
	  destruction has been deffered until it finds out that the frame
	  is no longer being processed. Admittedly, this feels like a hack.
	  But, it does fix the issue, and I was not able to think of a
	  better solution ... ........

	* apps/app_directory.c: Big improvement for app_directory. This
	  patch breaks the do_directory function up so that it is more
	  easily parsed by the human brain. It also fixes some errors. I'll
	  quote dimas from the original bug description: "app_directory
	  contained some duplicate code even before addition of 'm' option.
	  Addition of that option doubled amount of that code. Worst of
	  all, there are minor differences between these code block and
	  bugs caused by these differences. 1. There is a memory leak. In
	  the 'menu' mode, result of the convert(pos) function is not freed
	  while it should be. 2. In the 'menu' mode check for
	  OPT_LISTBYFIRSTNAME flag ('f' option) is not negated as result,
	  application works in the mode opposite to what user expect
	  (checking last name when user wants the first nd vice versa). 3.
	  select_item function plays message for user using res = func1()
	  || func2() || func3()... construct. This construct loses the
	  actual value returned by ast_waitstream() for example so at the
	  end, res does not contain digit user dialed while listening to
	  the message. 4. (also in 1.4) application announces entries from
	  voicemail.conf/realtime separately from entries from users.conf.
	  I see no reason why doing so instead of building combined list.
	  5. Alot of duplicated code as already mentioned." This was tested
	  by dimas and I (I tested under valgrind). A word of caution: any
	  bug fixes that happen in app_directory in 1.4 will almost
	  certainly not merge cleanly into trunk as a result of this, but
	  it is well worth it. Huge thanks to dimas for this wonderful
	  submission. (closes issue #11744) Reported by: dimas Patches:

	  team/russell/jack/. Add a new module, app_jack, which provides
	  interfaces to JACK, the Jack Audio Connection Kit
	  (http://www.jackaudio.org/). Two interfaces are provided; there
	  is a JACK() application, and a JACK_HOOK() function. Both
	  interfaces create an input and output JACK port. The application
	  makes these ports the endpoint of the call. The audio coming from
	  the channel goes out the output port and whatever comes back in
	  on the input port is what gets sent to the channel. The
	  JACK_HOOK() function turns on a JACK audiohook on the channel.
	  This lets you run the audio coming from a channel through JACK,
	  and whatever comes back in is what gets forwarded on as the
	  channel's audio. This is very useful for building custom vocoders
	  or doing recording or analysis of the channel's audio in another
	  application. In case anyone is curious, the platform that
	  inspired me to write this is PureData (http://puredata.info/). I
	  wrote these JACK interfaces so that I could use Pd to do
	  interesting things with the audio of phone calls ...

	  double, to a float, back to a double. Sure enough, when I changed
	  my interim variable back to a double, it still blows up.
	  Switching all of these to a float fixes the problem. This seems
	  like a compiler bug where a double passed as an argument isn't
	  getting properly aligned, so I'll have to see if I can replicate
	  it with a small test program. (related to issue #11725)

	  main code to implement the textarea is in console_board.c, and
	  uses a simple png image with the font, blitting characters on the
	  designated areas of the main screen. Additionally we provide some
	  annotations in the image used as a skin to indicate which areas
	  are used for text messages. (images will be committed

	  main/http.c, build_tools/make_version_h (removed),
	  include/asterisk, main/asterisk.c: Now that the version.h file
	  was getting properly regenerated every time the svn revision
	  changed, every module that used the version was getting rebuilt
	  after every svn update. This severly annoyed me pretty quickly,
	  so I have improved the situation. Now, instead of generating
	  version.h, main/version.c is generated. version.c includes the
	  version information, as well as a couple of API calls for modules
	  to retrieve the version. So now, only version.c will get rebuilt,
	  and the main asterisk binary relinked, which is must faster than
	  rebuilding http.c, manager.c, asterisk.c, relinking the asterisk
	  binary, chan_sip.c, func_version.c, res_agi ... The only minor
	  change in behavior here is that the version information reported
	  by chan_sip, for example, is the version of the Asterisk core,
	  and not necessarily the Asterisk version that the chan_sip module
	  came from.

	* channels/chan_console.c: Add support for generating a ringing

	  ringback when making an outbound call. But hey, it works, and you
	  get the localized ring tone for the appropriate language set on
	  the channel.

	* main/loader.c: some cleanup of this code while I am trying to
	  debug a problem with gdb dying while debugging asterisk. The
	  problem seems to be related with a race in the handling of
	  module_list, which in turn is triggeded by calling dlopen() on a
	  system which uses initializers to create locks.

	* include/asterisk/module.h: There are three instances of the
	  module definition macros, which make maintaining this file very
	  error prone. This commit merges the embedded and !embedded
	  versions, and fixes the C++ version. Eventually we should move to
	  a single version of the macro. Too bad C++ doesn't like the
	  C-style struct initializers .foo = some_value

	* codecs/Makefile, codecs/codec_resample.c: make codec_resample
	  build on __CYGWIN__, and make it load on FreeBSD (and probably
	  other systems as well). Both need libresample.a to be specified
	  in the linking phase, and cygwin needs <float.h> as other BSD.
	  The checks for OS-specific headers should really be moved to some
	  common header though.

	* build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  funcs/func_iconv.c, makeopts.in: implement "configure" checks for
	  libiconv, and add the iconv dependency for func_iconv. This fixes

	  complained about volume issues when the current codec_g722
	  converts to 8 kHz signed linear. But, to test this, you will have

	  reported and patched by eliel)

2007-12-31 16:13 +0000 [r95383-95412]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* configs/console.conf.sample (added), configs/modules.conf.sample,
	  channels/chan_console.c (added), CHANGES: Merge the main set of
	  changes from team/russell/chan_console. Add a new console channel
	  driver, chan_console, which is a console channel driver that uses
	  portaudio as a cross platform audio interface. It was written to
	  provide a console channel driver that works with Mac CoreAudio,
	  but it supports a number of other audio interfaces, as well,
	  including OSS and ALSA. It could one day be the single console
	  channel driver, but does not yet have as many features as
	  chan_oss.

	* include/asterisk/channel.h: fix a spelling error in a comment

	* include/asterisk/config.h: Add CV_STRINGFIELD() macro. This lets
	  you set a config variable to a string field. (from
	  team/russell/chan_console)

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in: Regenerate configure
	  script to include check for portaudio.

	* build_tools/menuselect-deps.in, configure.ac, makeopts.in: Add
	  configure script checking for portaudio.

2007-12-29 02:02 +0000 [r95262-95313]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/vcodecs.c, channels/console_video.c, channels/Makefile,
	  channels/console_video.h, channels/vgrabbers.c (added): Move
	  grabbers definitions to a separate file, vgrabbers.c, so it is
	  easier to add more entries. This required moving struct grab_desc
	  to the common header, and adding an entry in the Makefile. On
	  passing, cleanup some comments and file headers (some are still
	  missing).

	* channels/console_gui.c, channels/console_video.c: virtualize the
	  interface for video grabbers, which should make it easier to add
	  support for more grabbers (V4L2, firewire, and so on).

	* channels/console_video.c: Add a few entries up to 1408x1152 in
	  the table of known video resolutions. This makes it very
	  convenient to enlarge images using the right-click on the video
	  window.

	* channels/vcodecs.c, channels/console_video.c: change the
	  interface of video encapsulation routines, they only need the
	  buffer and mtu as input.

	* channels/console_gui.c, channels/vcodecs.c,
	  channels/console_video.c, channels/console_video.h: various
	  rearrangements and renaming of console_video stuff

2007-12-28 18:39 +0000 [r95233]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: The diff for this change looks really bad, but
	  all I did here was decrease the indentation of most of the
	  queue_exec function by reversing the logic of an if statement.
	  This change makes the function comply better with the coding
	  guidelines. Since this change is purely a cosmetic change to the
	  code, I am only committing the change to trunk.

	  managed to reproduce it in a small setup. If a queue uses the
	  ringall strategy, it was possible through unfortunate coincidence
	  for a single member at a given penalty level to make app_queue
	  think that all members at that penalty level were unavailable and
	  cause the members at the next penalty level to be rung. With this
	  patch, we will only move to the next penalty level if ALL the
	  members at a given penalty level are unreachable. ........

	* channels/console_gui.c: more steps to decouple the gui from the

	* channels/console_gui.c, channels/console_video.c,
	  channels/console_video.h: Enable building the code even if SDL is
	  not present (similarly, SDL is also detected at runtime). Now we
	  should be able to stream video even without a rendering device
	  (useful for remote monitoring).

	* channels/console_gui.c, channels/console_video.c: more
	  localizations around sdl_setup

	  16bpp so we can create YUVoverlays. With this change we can do
	  setenv SDL_VIDEODRIVER aalib and output to an ascii window (which
	  is still in an X11 window). If you also do unsetenv DISPLAY then
	  the output goes into the main asterisk window, unfortunately it

	  case, i don't think we are very far away from having a working
	  xterm videophone!

	* configs/oss.conf.sample, channels/console_video.c: Change the
	  name of config file entries for keypad regions from
	  'keypad_entry' to 'region'. Fix the example file accordingly.
	  Also make some fixes in the code do reset entries on reload of
	  the keypad. The recently committed kpad2.jpg has the correct
	  names.

	* images/kpad2.jpg (added): add a sample keypad (with annotations)
	  for console video

	* channels/console_video.c, channels/Makefile, channels/chan_oss.c,
	  channels/console_video.h (added): Build console_video support by
	  linking in, as opposed to including, console_video.c This will
	  ease the task of splitting console_video.c into its components
	  (V4L and X11 grabbers, various video codecs and packetizers,
	  SDL), as well as ease future extensions (e.g. additional video
	  sources, codecs and rendering engines). For the time being
	  nothing changes for users: video support is off by default, and
	  requires -DHAVE_VIDEO_CONSOLE on the command line to be included
	  (if SDL and FFMPEG are available).

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: Something I've been itching to do for a
	  while now. A minor optimization in app_voicemail. Since the
	  dtable in base_encode always gets populated with the same values
	  every time and never changes, make it static and const and only
	  initialize it once. Also, there's no reason to define
	  BASEMAXINLINE twice, so remove the redundant #define.

2007-12-21 01:14 +0000 [r94345-94396]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* apps/app_queue.c: Moved the update of the queue_ent's rule list
	  to just before we try to call queue members. This allows for the
	  change in penalty levels to be executed at the most logical time
	  frame.

	* configs/queues.conf.sample, doc/tex/channelvariables.tex,
	  apps/app_queue.c, configs/queuerules.conf.sample (added): Merging
	  the queue-penalty branch. In short, this allows one to
	  dynamically adjust the QUEUE_MAX_PENALTY and the newly introduced
	  QUEUE_MIN_PENALTY during a call depending on the amount of time
	  passed. The purpose is to allow the call to open up to more (or
	  maybe just different) members without the caller's losing his
	  place in the queue. See configs/queuerules.conf.sample for an
	  example of how to set up queue rules and
	  configs/queues.conf.sample for how to associate a rule with a
	  queue. Along with the functional changes, new CLI and manager
	  commands exist to show the rules defined and there is an
	  additional CLI command to reload the queue rules. Future
	  enhancements that may be made: support for realtime queue rules
	  and support for dynamically adding a rule through the manager or
	  CLI. Also a manager command to reload the queue rules (I'll
	  probably write this myself very soon).

	* apps/app_voicemail.c: The changes to header inclusion in trunk
	  broke compilation of app_voicemail when using IMAP storage. The
	  reason is that c-client has its own definitions for LOG_WARNING
	  and LOG_DEBUG, so we need to be sure to include asterisk's
	  definitions last so that we use the proper values in
	  app_voicemail. (closes issue #11437, reported by blitzrage, patch
	  suggested by blitzrage)

	* channels/chan_usbradio.c, include/asterisk/config.h,
	  channels/console_video.c, channels/chan_oss.c: add some macros to
	  simplify parsing the config file, see description in config.h .
	  They are a variant of the set of macros i used in chan_oss.c,
	  structured in a way to be more robust to the presence of spurious
	  ';' - basically, they define wrappers for 'do {' and '} while
	  (0)', plus some helper functions to deal with simple cases such
	  as ast_copy_string, ast_malloc, strtoul, ast_true ... The prefix
	  (CV_ as 'Config Variable') tries to be easy to remember and has
	  been chosen to not conflict with other existing macros in the
	  tree. For the time being, I have only updated the three source
	  files in the tree that used the old M_* macros. Hopefully, more
	  files will be converted. NOTE: I understand that inventing my own
	  dialect of C is generally wrong; however, the lack of adequate
	  support in the language encourages lazy programming practices
	  (such as ignoring errors, bounds, etc.) and this increases the
	  chance of vulnerability in the code, especially because we are
	  parsing user input here. Hopefully, these macros and the use of
	  ast_parse_arg (in config.h) should encourage the programmer to
	  write more robust code.

	* include/asterisk/paths.h, res/snmp/agent.c, utils/ael_main.c,
	  utils/extconf.c, main/asterisk.c, utils/conf2ael.c: modify
	  http://svn.digium.com/view/asterisk?view=rev&rev=93603 so that
	  paths and filename are writable by asterisk.c without causing
	  segfaults. This involves defining the variables as const char *,
	  and having them point to as static, writable buffer defined in
	  asterisk.c On passing, fix some errors in using these variables
	  in some files in utils/ , and in res/snmp/agent.c which was
	  redefining a variable without using paths.h (not applicable to
	  1.4)

	  | 23 lines In
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2007-December/031145.html,
	  rizzo brought up some issues related to the way that the metadata
	  required for menuselect and the rest of the build system is
	  extracted from the source files. Since I had a few hours to kill
	  on an airplane today, I decided to improve this situation... so
	  now the system caches the extracted metadata and uses it to build
	  the menuselect 'tree' as much as it can. The result of this is
	  that when a single source file is changed, only the metadata for
	  that file needs to be extracted again, and the rest is used from
	  the cache files. I also reduced the number of forked processes
	  required to do the metadata extraction; it was actually possible
	  to do most of what we needed in the Makefiles themselves without
	  using any shell scripts at all! On my laptop, these changes
	  resulted in an 80% decrease in the time required for the
	  'menuselect.makeopts' automatic check to occur after editing a
	  single source file. While doing this work I also cleaned up a few
	  minor things in the Makefiles, adding a check for 'awk' to the
	  configure script and changed all remaining places we use 'grep'
	  or 'awk' to use the ones found by the configure script, and
	  changed the 'prep_tarball' script to build the menuselect
	  metadata so that tarballs of Asterisk will include it and won't
	  require the user to wait while it is extracted after unpacking.

	* configs/oss.conf.sample: configuration options related to video
	  support.

	* channels/console_video.c (added): Bring in video console support
	  for chan_oss (and later chan_alsa too). This is disabled in the
	  default build, you need to explicitly enable it compiling with
	  make COPTS=-DHAVE_VIDEO_CONSOLE In return, you will be able to do
	  a video call with chan_oss, using the webcam (or X11 grabbing) as
	  local source, and rendering the incoming stream on your screen.
	  Currently supported formats are h261, h263, h263+, h264, mpeg4
	  (all through the avcodec lib, part of ffmpeg). Incoming video is
	  on the left, outgoing video is on the right, while the center
	  displays a keypad (if configured so). Right clicking on the video
	  windows increases the size, center clicking reduces the size.
	  Dragging the mouse (with the left key) on the right window while
	  the X11 grabber is active moves the grab area. This is the result
	  of work by Sergio Fadda, Marta Carbone and myself, all properly
	  disclaimed to digium. Note, there is a lot of work left to do in
	  this module, including adding support for Video4LinuxV2 (I have
	  patches from Matteo Brancaleoni which should be integrated), and
	  making the GUI a lot more friendly than it is now (e.g.
	  supporting merging or switching among multiple sources, a text
	  window, and more).

	* build_tools/make_version, build_tools/make_version_h:
	  simplify/cleanup the scripts

	* utils/Makefile: remove relative paths and use ASTTOPDIR instead.
	  Give a default value to ASTTOPDIR if unset so we can at least do
	  a 'make clean' without too much trouble. The proper fix, however,
	  is to partition the top level Makefile in a 'setup' and a 'main'
	  part, in a way that the 'setup' part can be included from
	  subdirs' Makefiles and allow targets to be built without going
	  through the top level Makefile.

	* utils/clicompat.c: simplify this file

	* doc/CODING-GUIDELINES: add a bit of info on the build
	  infrastructure

	* Makefile: Fix the detection of modules installed from this build.
	  You can now add the path of local module subdirs from the command
	  line with make LOCAL_MOD_SUBDIRS= ....

	* codecs/Makefile, apps/Makefile, Makefile.moddir_rules,
	  cdr/Makefile, pbx/Makefile, res/Makefile, channels/Makefile,
	  formats/Makefile, funcs/Makefile: Put into Makefile.moddir_rules
	  the common instructions used to generate loadable and embedded
	  module lists. Individual Makefiles now are a lot simpler,
	  possibly as simple as this: -include
	  $(ASTTOPDIR)/menuselect.makeopts $(ASTTOPDIR)/menuselect.makedeps
	  MODULE_PREFIX=cdr_ all: _all include
	  $(ASTTOPDIR)/Makefile.moddir_rules and also more flexible because
	  in a single directory we can combine various types of modules
	  (app_, cdr_, func_, ... ) by simply listing them in the
	  MODULE_PREFIX variable. The individual Makefiles can also create
	  list of modules to be excluded by listing them in the variablel
	  MODULE_EXCLUDE (see an example in channels/Makefile). With this
	  change it becomes trivial to integrate a directory with locally
	  created/modified sources into the main build.

	* Makefile, Makefile.moddir_rules: make the install target a bit
	  less noisy

	* Makefile: document usage of several exported variables

	* utils/Makefile: add hashtab.c to the list of files deleted

	* Makefile.moddir_rules: another place where ../ should have been
	  ASTTOPDIR

	* codecs/Makefile, utils/Makefile, apps/Makefile, cdr/Makefile,
	  pbx/Makefile, res/Makefile, channels/Makefile, formats/Makefile,
	  funcs/Makefile: normalize subdirs' Makefile by using ASTTOPDIR
	  and not .. to reference the top level directory.

	* Makefile: Implement the outcome of a discussion on the -dev list
	  re. the use of DESTDIR and INSTALL_PATH - many thanks to Tzafrir
	  Cohen and Simon Perreault for extremely useful feedback: 1.
	  comment out the [directories] section the created asterisk.conf ;
	  you can set the correct defaults at build time using
	  INSTALL_PATH, so the repetition here is redundant and often
	  wrong. (The next step now is move asterisk.conf outside the
	  Makefile to asterisk.conf.sample, because there is little if
	  anything here that needs to be constructed at build/install
	  time). 2. use DESTDIR?=$(INSTALL_PATH) so you only need to
	  specify a path once if the two coincide. This should have no ill
	  side effects, because if you don't specify DESTDIR, you really
	  need INSTALL_PATH="" to set the correct defaults, and if you
	  specify DESTDIR the value is not overridden. The second part
	  required moving the 'export DESTDIR' right after the assignment
	  to prevent DESTDIR getting set by the export (this is documented
	  in the Makefile).o hopefully avoid the mistake)$ With this change
	  you can now do something like this from your source tree: make
	  INSTALL_PATH=/some/place install samples and then main/asterisk
	  -vdc which will pick up the correct config files and libraries
	  from /some/place - i.e. great for developers!

	* main/config.c: remove unused code, and simplify the logic for
	  #include/#exec (still a lot of cleanup needed here).

	* main/config.c: Implement comment_buffer and lline_buffer in terms
	  of the ast_str_*() API. I don't know if comment_buffers etc are
	  actually used at all...

	* main/config.c: unify some common code

	* main/config.c: normalize formatting

	* main/config.c: document a nice technique to exit from a block in
	  case of errors.

	* main/config.c: a little bit of documentation on how lines are
	  parsed.

	* utils/ael_main.c: normalize header order, and add a comment on
	  the need to clean up this file.

	* include/asterisk/network.h: some platforms (e.g. FreeBSD4) need
	  netinet/in.h to be included before arpa/inet.h

	* doc/manager_1_1.txt (added), UPGRADE.txt: Adding documentation
	  for the massive manager changes to manager version 1.1 -
	  hopefully a more consistent manager interface.

	* main/manager.c: - The Ping Action - Now use Response: success -
	  New header "Ping: pong" :-) - The Events action - Now use
	  Response: Success - The new status is reported as "Events: On" or
	  "Events: Off" - Report if manager is enabled in the reload event
	  Small cleanups... From moremanager

	* main/channel.c: Changes to manager events in channel.c - Newstate
	  event - Now has "CalleridNum" for numeric caller id, like
	  Newchannel - The event does not send "<unknown>" for unknown
	  caller IDs just an empty field - Newstate and Newchannel events -
	  these have changed headers "State" -> ChannelStateDesc Text based
	  channel state -> ChannelState Numeric channel state - The events
	  does not send "<unknown>" for unknown caller IDs just an empty
	  field - Newstate event - Now has "CalleridNum" for numeric caller
	  id, like Newchannel - The event does not send "<unknown>" for
	  unknown caller IDs just an empty field - Link and Unlink events -
	  The "Link" and "Unlink" bridge events in channel.c are now
	  renamed to "Bridge" - The link state is in the bridgestate:
	  header as "Link" or "Unlink" - For channel.c bridges,
	  "Bridgetype: core" is added. This opens up for bridge events in
	  rtp.c and channel drivers - The "Rename" manager event has a
	  renamed header, to use the same terminology for the current
	  channel as other events - Oldname -> Channel (Moremanager)

	* main/cdr.c: New manager event when a channel changes account
	  code. Maybe belongs in the new cdr category? ---moremanager---
	  Event: NewAccountCode Modules: cdr.c Purpose: To report a change
	  in account code for a live channel Example: Event: NewAccountCode
	  Privilege: call,all Channel: SIP/olle-01844600 Uniqueid:
	  1177530895.2 AccountCode: Stinas account 1234848484
	  OldAccountCode: Olles Account 12345

	* apps/app_dial.c: - Dial event - Event Dial has new headers, to
	  comply with other events - Source -> Channel Channel name
	  (caller) - SrcUniqueID -> UniqueID Uniqueid (new) -> Dialstring
	  Dialstring in app data (moremanager)

	* apps/app_meetme.c: Adding small missing but important comma...

	* apps/app_meetme.c: A big oops...

	* apps/app_meetme.c: The MeetmeJoin now has caller ID name and
	  Caller ID number fields (like MeetMeLeave) (Moremanager)

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Update ZapShowChannels so that you can
	  specify one channel. Action ZapShowChannels Header changes -
	  Channel: -> ZapChannel For active channels, the Channel: and
	  Uniqueid: headers are added You can now add a "ZapChannel: "
	  argument to zapshowchannels actions to only get information about
	  one channel. From the moremanager branch

	  call to ast_parseable_goto on the answering channel since it is a
	  wasteful call. The answering channel and the calling channel are
	  both directed to the same extension and context, just different
	  priorities, so we can just copy the values from the calling
	  channel to the answering channel and increment the answering
	  channel's priority. (closes issue #11382, reported by jon, patch

	  option enables MWI monitoring. When the MWI state on a line
	  changes, then the script specified by mwimonitornotify will be
	  executed for custom handling of the state change, similar to the
	  externnotify option of voicemail.conf. Also, when the MWI state
	  on an FXO line changes, an internal Asterisk event is generated
	  to indicate the new state of the associated mailbox. That may,
	  any module that cares about MWI information will get notified and
	  can handle it just as if app_voicemail had sent this
	  notification. (BE-253, original patch from markster, with some

	  ........ r90735 | mmichelson | 2007-12-03 17:12:17 -0600 (Mon, 03
	  Dec 2007) | 22 lines A big one... This is the merge of the
	  forward-loop branch. The main change here is that call-forwards
	  can no longer loop. This is accomplished by creating a datastore
	  on the calling channel which has a linked list of all devices
	  dialed. If a forward happens, then the local channel which is
	  created inherits the datastore. If, through this progression of
	  forwards and datastore inheritance, a device is attempted to be
	  dialed a second time, it will simply be skipped and a warning
	  message will be printed to the CLI. After the dialing has been
	  completed, the datastore is detached from the channel and
	  destroyed. This change also introduces some side effects to the
	  code which I shall enumerate here: 1. Datastore inheritance has
	  been backported from trunk into 1.4 2. A large chunk of code has
	  been removed from app_dial. This chunk is the section of code
	  which handles the call forward case after the channel has been
	  requested but before it has been called. This was removed because
	  call-forwarding still works fine without it, it makes the code
	  less error-prone should it need changing, and it made this set of
	  changes much less painful to just have the forwarding handled in
	  one place in each module. 3. Two new files, global_datastores.h
	  and .c have been added. These are necessary since the datastore
	  which is attached to the channel may be created and attached in
	  either app_dial or app_queue, so they need a common place to find
	  the datastore info. This approach was taken in case similar
	  datastores are needed in the future, there will be a common place
	  to add them. ........

	  sets a channel variable for every priority executed in the

	  pointless due to the fact that these channel variables are not
	  referenced anywhere else in the code and their names are esoteric
	  enough that they would not be practical to reference in the
	  dialplan. Plus the fact that this behavior isn't documented
	  anywhere means that the change is not likely to cause any
	  disruption. If anything, this may actually cause a slight
	  performance increase if running with debug on. The motivating
	  influence for this code change is the eventwhencalled option for
	  queues. If set to vars, all channel variables will be output to
	  the manager. These unnecessary channel variables make the output
	  a lot more difficult to deal with. ........

	  not find it in memory, we search realtime instead. 2. When moh is
	  restarted (as in, it had been started on this particular channel,
	  stopped, and now we're starting it again), if using the "files"
	  mode, then realtime will always be rechecked. If you are using
	  other modes, however, we will simply reattach to the external
	  running process which was playing moh earlier in the call. This
	  is a necessary compromise so that we don't end up with too many
	  background processes. 3. musiconhold.conf has a general section
	  now. It has one option: cachertclasses. If set to yes, then moh
	  classes found in realtime will be added to the in-memory list.
	  This has the advantage of not requiring database lookups each
	  time moh is started, but it has the disadvantage of not truly
	  being realtime. I have tested this for functionality, and it
	  passes. I also tested this under valgrind and there are no memory
	  problems reported under typical use. Special thanks to Sergee for
	  implementing this feature and enduring my complaints on the
	  bugtracker! (closes issue #11196, reported and patched by sergee)

	  was the global IAX frame queue. This queue was used to hold

	  41 lines Merge changes from team/russell/autoservice_1.4 This set
	  of changes fixes an issue that was reported to me on IRC
	  yesterday. The user, d1mas, was using chan_zap for incoming calls
	  and was having DTMF recognition issues in some situations.
	  Specifically, he noticed that the problem occurred when using
	  DISA or WaitExten. He also noticed that when using Read, the
	  problem did not occur. His system also used DUNDi for dialplan
	  lookups. So, he theorized that if the DUNDi lookups blocked for
	  some period of time, that audio from the zap channel could get
	  lost. If the audio got lost, then it wouldn't be run through the
	  DTMF detector, and digits could get lost. He was correct, and the
	  following set of changes fixes the problem. However, the changes
	  go a little bit further than what was necessary to fix this exact
	  problem. 1) I updated pbx_extension_helper() to autoservice the
	  associated channel to handle cases where extension lookups may
	  take a long time. This would normally be a dialplan switch that
	  does some lookup over the network, such as the DUNDi or IAX2
	  switches. This ensures that even while a DUNDi lookup is
	  blocking, the channel will be continuously serviced. 2) I made a
	  change to the autoservice code. This is actually something that
	  has bothered me for a long time. When a channel is in
	  autoservice, _all_ frames get thrown away. However, some frames
	  really shouldn't be thrown away. The most notable examples are
	  signalling (CONTROL) frames, and DTMF. So, this patch queues up
	  important frames while a channel is in autoservice. When
	  autoservice is stopped on the channel, the queued up frames get
	  stuck back on the channel so that they can get processed instead
	  of thrown away. 3) I made another change to the autoservice code
	  to handle the case where autoservice is started on channels
	  recursively. Previously, you could call ast_autoservice_start()
	  multiple times on a channel, and it would stop the first time
	  ast_autoservice_stop() gets called. Now, it will ensure that
	  autoservice doesn't actually stop until the final call to
	  ast_autoservice_stop(). ........

	  Deprecate "call-limit" in chan_sip. No other channel driver
	  enforces call-limits and we now have the groupcount system to
	  implement call-limits in the dialplan. You can use the "setvar"
	  option in realtime/sip.conf to set limits per device. - Implement
	  "callcounter" as a new option to enable the call counting we need
	  to report device status to queue, manager and SIP subscriptions.
	  The call counter setting is now enabled in the code by setting
	  the device call-limit to 999. When we remove the call limit, we
	  can simply enable this with a boolean setting.

	* main/pbx.c, include/asterisk/pbx.h, pbx/pbx_config.c,
	  configs/extensions.conf.sample: closes issue #11363; where the
	  pattern _20x. buried in an included context, didn't match 2012;
	  There were a small set of problems to fix: 1. I needed NOT to
	  score patterns unless you are at the end of the data string. 2.
	  Capital N,X,Z and small n,x,z are OK in patterns. I canonicalize
	  the patterns in the trie to caps. 3. When a pattern ends with dot
	  or exclamation, CANMATCH/MATCHMORE should always report this
	  pattern, no matter the length. With this commit, I also supplied
	  the wish of Luigi, where the user can select which pattern
	  matching algorithm to use, the old (legacy) pattern matcher, or
	  the new, trie based matcher. The OLD matcher is the default. A
	  new [general] section variable, extenpatternmatchnew, is added to
	  the extensions.conf, and the example config has it set to false.
	  If true, the new matcher is used. In all other respects, the
	  context/exten structs are the same; the tries and hashtabs are
	  formed, but in the new mode the tries are not used. A new CLI
	  command 'dialplan set extenpatternmatch true/false' is provided
	  to allow switching at run time. I beg users that are forced to
	  return to the old matcher to please report the reason in the bug
	  tracker. Measured the speed benefit of the new matcher against an
	  impossibly large context with 10,000 extensions: the new matcher
	  is 374 times faster.

	  - move the ast_group structure to channel.h to remove the
	  dependency of app.h on linkedlists.h Note, this is a long process
	  that I am doing in small steps. The main difficulty is that now
	  for each subsystem we have a single header (e.g. channel.h)
	  included by the subsystem provider (usually one file, e.g.
	  channel.c) and by its clients (dozens of them, e.g. we have some
	  70+ apps and 30+ functions). This requires the clients to include
	  all the extra headers required by the provider (eg. lock.h,
	  linkedlists.h, definitions of substructures...) even though many
	  of the clients would be just happy with opaque struct
	  declarations and function prototypes. The long term plan is to
	  eventually rectify this structure so that the compilation can
	  become faster, and also APIs are more stable.

	  closes issue #11285, where an unload of a module that creates a
	  dialplan context, causes a crash when you do a 'dialplan show' of
	  that context. This is because the registrar string is defined in
	  the module, and the stale pointer is traversed. The reporter
	  offered a patch that would always strdup the registrar string,
	  which is practical, but I preferred to destroy the created
	  contexts in each module where one is created. That seemed more
	  symmetric. There were only 6 place in asterisk where this is
	  done: chan_sip, chan_iax2, chan_skinny, res_features, app_dial,
	  and app_queue. The two apps destroyed the context, but left the
	  contexts. All is fixed now and unloads should be dialplan
	  friendly.

	* main/pbx.c: closes issue #11290; the proposed patch was a good
	  guess, and would solve the bug to some extent, but was really
	  masking the real issue, that there were bad entries in the table.
	  This fix removes the condition that the hashtab updates be done
	  on exten removal only when the pattern_tree was present, which is
	  silly. The operations that apply to the pattern tree are instead
	  made conditional. Also, threw back in routines that kpfleming
	  deleted because of probs in the 64-bit world. Tested on both 32
	  and 64-bit machines (compile). Tested the reload problem with
	  over 20 reloads, and no problems. If you find more problems,
	  please reopen 11290.

2007-11-21 18:19 +0000 [r89487]  Mark Michelson <mmichelson@digium.com>

	* main/utils.c: There existed about a 1 in 4 billion chance that
	  reading from /dev/urandom would return LONG_MIN (1 in 9
	  quintillion if using 64-bit longs). Since there is no positive
	  equivalent of LONG_MIN, the result of labs() in this case is
	  unpredictable. This fixes that situation. (closes issue #11336,

	* main/pbx.c: I introduced a deadlock avoidance into 1.4, which I
	  attempted to port to trunk as well. Unfortunately, since trunk
	  uses read/write locks for the context lock, it means that I have
	  actually *introduced* a deadlock condition since they are not
	  recursive. Removing this change for now and will look into
	  introducing a different one.

	* include/asterisk.h, include/asterisk/compat.h, utils/ael_main.c,
	  utils/conf2ael.c: move these forward declarations back to
	  asterisk.h where they belong... even though asterisk.h includes
	  compat.h, these declarations have nothing to do with the being
	  platform-compatible and are directly related to being part of
	  Asterisk

	* channels/chan_usbradio.c: get this to actually compile...

	* main/pbx.c: remove some debugging code that doesn't compile on

	* main/pbx.c: A free in add_pri was ultimately the source of the
	  grief we were having with parking. This set of changes fixes that
	  problem, and introduces some more error messages, and puts debugs

	  r89457 | mmichelson | 2007-11-20 11:50:31 -0600 (Tue, 20 Nov
	  2007) | 9 lines According to comments in main/pbx.c, it is
	  essential that if we are going to lock the conlock as well as the
	  hints lock, it must be locked in that respective order. In order
	  to prevent a potential deadlock, we need to lock the conlock
	  prior to locking the hints lock in ast_hint_state_changed (see
	  the call stack example on issue #11323 for how this can happen).

	* channels/chan_sip.c, CHANGES: Changed the "busy-level" option in
	  sip.conf to "busylevel" to be more parallel with the SIPPEER()
	  argument of the same name. The deprecation procedure is not being
	  used here since this is a trunk-only option. (closes issue

2007-11-19 23:03 +0000 [r89439-89440]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* funcs/func_sysinfo.c: Make the SYSINFO documentation reflect
	  which options were compiled in

2007-11-19 22:55 +0000 [r89438]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c: These changes were made in response to
	  niklas@tese.se's letter of 11-17-2007, where he had 20 and 201 in
	  two different contexts, included in the same context. In that
	  particular case, we were behaving the same as 1.4, but after
	  experimenting, I quickly found that if 20 and 201 were in the
	  same extension, 1.4 would return 201, and this code returns 20.
	  These changes now enable the current code to replicate the
	  behavior of 1.4 in respect to MATCHMORE in cases like this.

	* CHANGES: Update CHANGES

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Adding busy-level to the SIP_PEER() dialplan
	  function. With this, you can control the peer in the dialplan, so
	  you avoid placing outbound calls when the device has reached
	  busy-level. Reported by pj. Closes bug #11180

	* main/acl.c: Add some debugging to the routines that finds our
	  local IP address. Related to bug #9225

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make some notes about a problem I found with
	  the OPTIONs handler while working with the bug tracker. Since we
	  don't authenticate devices (peers/users) on OPTIONS we don't have
	  the proper context set for the user/peer. However, we might not
	  want to process an authentication for every OPTIONS, so we could
	  have a config option for this, "optionsforceok" to always answer
	  200 OK on the request and not check device or destination, nor
	  add a SDP. If Asterisk sends the OPTIONs request, it doesn't care
	  about the reply. Some devices use OPTIONs to discover
	  capabilities, since we should answer like an INVITE from the
	  device and we need to support that properly too, which we don't
	  today. So much to do :-)

2007-11-18 21:50 +0000 [r89394-89399]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* build_tools/make_buildopts_h: Add OSX into the logic that uses
	  md5 instead of md5sum.

	* include/asterisk/compat.h: Use the easy way that rizzo mentioned,
	  only include malloc.h on the Windows platform.

	* include/asterisk/compat.h: Revert last commit, apparently
	  buildbot lied to me.

	* include/asterisk/compat.h: Change how we handle alloca to conform
	  with how it is suggested in the autoconf manual for
	  AC_FUNC_ALLOCA. FreeBSD 6 now builds again and no other platforms
	  should be broken by this.

	* configure, configure.ac: Change autoconf logic a bit so it says
	  what it is looking for in two instances where it didn't.

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  include/asterisk/lock.h, include/asterisk/network.h: Use autoconf
	  logic to determine the presence of
	  PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP and
	  PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP. Enclose error message from network.h
	  in "

2007-11-17 21:47 +0000 [r89393]  Matthew Fredrickson <creslin@digium.com>

	* channels/chan_zap.c: Add SS7 Generic address support (#11156)

2007-11-17 19:29 +0000 [r89389-89392]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* include/asterisk/compat.h: if alloca.h is not present, try
	  malloc.h

	* agi/Makefile: temporarily disable this target in mingw

	* Makefile: will i ever get precedences for windows right ? in the
	  meantime, use a variable to ease enabling/disabling print
	  subdirectories.

	* Makefile: reformulate dependencies in a more correct way

2007-11-17 17:46 +0000 [r89388]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c, pbx/pbx_dundi.c: a quick fix to pbx_dundi.c to make
	  it so it will compile. Hope I did the right thing. And some
	  additions to removal of extens to take care of hashtab pointers
	  in all cases.

2007-11-17 17:27 +0000 [r89363-89387]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* Makefile.moddir_rules, Makefile.rules: as discussed some time ago
	  on the -dev list, create embedde object with a .eo suffix even if
	  they are coming from .cc sources. This simplifies the handling in
	  the build scripts.

	* include/asterisk/network.h: prefer socket.h over other variants
	  (winsock etc.)

	* channels/chan_local.c, main/translate.c,
	  channels/chan_features.c, main/http.c, main/config.c: trim more
	  redundant headers

	* main/acl.c: remove unnecessary includes

	* main/udptl.c, main/dnsmgr.c, channels/chan_sip.c, main/acl.c,
	  main/dns.c, main/rtp.c, main/netsock.c: fix breakage induced by
	  previous mistake

	* Makefile: wrong variable, wrong order -> broken build.

	* include/asterisk/acl.h, include/asterisk/utils.h,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, include/asterisk/rtp.h,
	  configure.ac, main/acl.c, include/asterisk/netsock.h,
	  main/utils.c, include/asterisk/manager.h, main/netsock.c,
	  main/manager.c, res/res_agi.c, pbx/pbx_dundi.c,
	  include/asterisk/udptl.h, include/asterisk/dnsmgr.h,
	  main/asterisk.c: start using asterisk/network.h for network
	  related headers. Also remove some unnecessary includes.

	* include/asterisk/network.h (added): wrapper for all generic
	  network headers that have different names and locations on the
	  various systems.

	* main/cygload.c: main is called main not amain!

	* main/Makefile: conditional targets for building the windows
	  version

	* Makefile: support cygwin targets

	* Makefile.moddir_rules: and this is the last one to have asterisk
	  compile (not run yet) natively under cygwin.

	* apps/app_sms.c: another cygwin compatibility fix. This one must
	  be handled in a better way in configure, also for other
	  architectures

	* utils/Makefile, main/Makefile, utils/extconf.c: more
	  cygwin/mingw32 compatibility fixes

	* include/asterisk/channel.h: use autoconf results to conditionally
	  compile timersub

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: compatibility fixes for cygwin

	* include/asterisk/compat.h: some version of flex produce code that
	  wants __STDC_VERSION__ defined, but the compiler does not always
	  define it.

	* Makefile: these linker flags apply to both cygwin and mingw32

	* utils/hashtest2.c: add a return NULL to a function that is
	  expected to return a value so compilers that don't understand
	  that this code is NOTREACHED will not complain (the fault is not
	  much on the compiler but on the declaration of pthread_exit on
	  certain platforms) s/certain platform/cygwin/ if you are really
	  curious

	* main/loader.c: define RTLD_LOCAL for platforms that don't have
	  it. This is only to complete the build, clearly the linker
	  behaviour will be completely different and likely to cause
	  trouble in those cases.

	* channels/Makefile: filter out modules that do not compile under
	  windows (this should be handled with the dependencies generated
	  by configure and menuselect, but will be fixed later)

	* main/utils.c: netdb.h is used for gethostbyname, and it was not
	  included in some platforms.

	* main/cygload.c (added): Loader for cygwin where asterisk is
	  really a big dll (something like this is already in 1.2)

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac:
	  timersub is a macro not a function, so write the check in a way
	  that detects both formats.

2007-11-17 06:34 +0000 [r89359-89362]  Russell Bryant <russell@digium.com>

	* pbx/pbx_lua.c: fix the build of pbx_lua

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in,
	  include/asterisk/compat.h, configure.ac, include/asterisk/io.h,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h: Update the configure script check for
	  sys/poll.h to also provide the result in
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h. Also, move the conditional include
	  of sys/poll.h or asterisk/poll-compat.h into asterisk/config.h
	  instead of the two headers it existed in before.

	* build_tools/make_buildopts_h: actually let this compile, oops :(

	* build_tools/make_buildopts_h: Use the fix suggested by Tilghman
	  on the -dev to make cutting up the BUILDSUM friendly to non-bash
	  shells. I think this should work for BSD/mingw as well, but did
	  not yet remove the switch statement.

2007-11-17 04:19 +0000 [r89348-89358]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* Makefile: linker flags for mingw32

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: add
	  detection for timersub() and winsock.h/winsock2.h

	* include/asterisk/endian.h: provide definitions for
	  __LITTLE_ENDIAN and __BIG_ENDIAN if not present.

	* main/Makefile, include/asterisk/io.h, include/asterisk/channel.h:
	  use poll as detected by configure

	* configure, configure.ac, makeopts.in: use autoconf to check for
	  the existence of sys/poll.h

	* build_tools/make_buildopts_h: this script is run on the build
	  system, not on the host.

	* Makefile.moddir_rules: compatibility fix for mingw32

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac,
	  acinclude.m4, makeopts.in: acinclude.m4: add a function to help
	  checking sdl-config, gtk-config and the like (this could be used
	  for gtk and gtk2 as well) Other files: add tests for sdl,
	  sdl_image and avcodec and regenerate configure and
	  autoconfig.h.in

	* include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac: add check for the
	  presence of glob

	* channels/chan_jingle.c, channels/chan_unistim.c,
	  funcs/func_enum.c, channels/chan_local.c, channels/chan_misdn.c,
	  channels/chan_skinny.c, funcs/func_odbc.c, channels/chan_h323.c,
	  utils/ael_main.c, cdr/cdr_pgsql.c, channels/chan_gtalk.c,
	  apps/app_db.c, channels/chan_mgcp.c: more removal of duplicate
	  #include lines

	* main/udptl.c, funcs/func_module.c, res/res_features.c,
	  funcs/func_lock.c, res/res_adsi.c, funcs/func_strings.c,
	  channels/chan_agent.c, pbx/dundi-parser.c, main/rtp.c,

	  main/logger.c, pbx/pbx_realtime.c, pbx/pbx_dundi.c,
	  apps/app_rpt.c, main/asterisk.c, apps/app_parkandannounce.c:
	  remove a bunch of duplicate includes Reproduce with grep -r
	  #include . | grep -v .svn | grep -v Binary | sort | uniq -c |
	  sort -nr

2007-11-16 23:44 +0000 [r89347]  Terry Wilson <twilson@digium.com>

	* res/res_features.c: Fix broken parking dial-back

2007-11-16 23:33 +0000 [r89346]  Steve Murphy <murf@digium.com>

	* main/pbx.c: My goodness, haven't handled an extension deletion.
	  Add code to ast_context_remove_extension2() to remove an
	  extension from the trie. Done by marking it deleted. The
	  scoreboard won't update for it any more. Also, a couple of calls
	  to insert hashtab had a spurious ->exten, which was removed.

2007-11-16 23:28 +0000 [r89341-89345]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* include/asterisk/paths.h, include/asterisk.h: paths are already
	  in include/asterisk/paths.h so don't duplicate them in
	  include/asterisk.h

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, include/asterisk/lock.h: whitespace
	  only change - adjust indentation and add some comments on the
	  content of these two files. utils.h (which is included in over
	  150 files) contains a lot of unrelated functions which require
	  the inclusion of a large number of other headers. At some point
	  we should partition its content in a better way.

2007-11-16 21:23 +0000 [r89333-89338]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* include/asterisk/logger.h: logger.h does not need options.h

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, channels/chan_sip.c,
	  include/asterisk/astobj.h, include/asterisk/compat.h,
	  include/asterisk/channel.h, include/asterisk/strings.h,
	  utils/extconf.c, include/asterisk/frame.h,
	  include/asterisk/stringfields.h, include/asterisk/endian.h:
	  remove redundant #include "asterisk/compat.h", but make sure that
	  asterisk/compiler.h is included everywhere

	* main/acl.c, main/asterisk.c: remove duplicate headers. Properly
	  check for netdb.h (there is actually tens of places to fix)

	* Makefile.rules: put back default optimization to -O6 (previously
	  changed by mistake)

	  change: use asterisk/compat.h to include a small set of system
	  headers: inttypes.h, unistd.h, stddef.h, stddint.h, sys/types.h,
	  stdarg.h, stdlib.h, alloca.h, stdio.h Where available, the
	  inclusion is conditional on HAVE_FOO_H as determined by autoconf.
	  Normally, source files should not include any of the above system
	  headers, and instead use either "asterisk.h" or
	  "asterisk/compat.h" which does it better. For the time being I
	  have left alone second-level directories (main/db1-ast, etc.).

	  | 4 lines To help combat problems where people build external
	  modules (asterisk-addons or others) and then change the build
	  options of the Asterisk build in a way that makes the
	  incompatible without warning, this commit introduces an MD5
	  signature of the important build-time options and includes that
	  signature into modules when they are built. When the loader loads
	  one of these modules and notices the problem, it will emit a
	  warning to console and refuse to initialize the module, as doing
	  so could cause the system to be unstable or even crash. If you
	  upgrade to this version of Asterisk, you must rebuild *all* of
	  your modules that came from other sources before trying to run
	  this version. If you are using Digium's G.729 binary codec
	  module, you will need v33 or newer. ........

	* res/ael/pval.c, utils/Makefile, main/pbx.c, main/hashtab.c
	  (added), main/Makefile, utils/hashtest.c (added), pbx/pbx_ael.c,
	  include/asterisk/hashtab.h (added), main/config.c: This is the
	  perhaps the biggest, boldest, most daring change I've ever
	  committed to trunk. Forgive me in advance any disruption this may
	  cause, and please, report any problems via the bugtracker. The
	  upside is that this can speed up large dialplans by 20 times (or
	  more). Context, extension, and priority matching are all fairly
	  constant-time searches. I introduce here my hashtables
	  (hashtabs), and a regression for them. I would have used the
	  ast_obj2 tables, but mine are resizeable, and don't need the
	  object destruction capability. The hashtab stuff is well tested
	  and stable. I introduce a data structure, a trie, for extension
	  pattern matching, in which knowledge of all patterns is
	  accumulated, and all matches can be found via a single traversal
	  of the tree. This is per-context. The trie is formed on the first
	  lookup attempt, and stored in the context for future lookups.
	  Destruction routines are in place for hashtabs and the pattern
	  match trie. You can see the contents of the pattern match trie by
	  using the 'dialplan show' cli command when 'core set debug' has
	  been done to put it in debug mode. The pattern tree traversal
	  only traverses those parts of the tree that are interesting. It
	  uses a scoreboard sort of approach to find the best match. The
	  speed of the traversal is more a function of the length of the
	  pattern than the number of patterns in the tree. The tree also
	  contains the CID matching patterns. See the source code comments
	  for details on how everything works. I believe the approach
	  general enough that any issues that might come up involving fine
	  points in the pattern matching algorithm, can be solved by just
	  tweaking things. We shall see. The current pattern matcher is
	  fairly involved, and replicating every nuance of it is difficult.
	  If you find and report problems, I will try to resolve than as
	  quickly as I can. The trie and hashtabs are added to the existing
	  context and exten structs, and none of the old machinery has been
	  removed for the sake of the multitude of functions that use them.
	  In the future, we can (maybe) weed out the linked lists and save
	  some space.

	* main/loader.c: Fix embedding of modules on FreeBSD: the
	  constructor for the list of modules was run after the
	  constructors for the embedded modules (which appended entries to

	  evidently different (it may depend on the ordering of modules in
	  the ELF file). This is only a workaround - there may be other
	  situations where the execution of constructors causes problems,
	  so if we manage to find a more general solution this workaround

	  linked list macros and in passing, simplified the code. I also

	  figure out at first. This bug showed itself with crashes showing
	  messed up head/tail pointers for the readq. However, there are a

	  5 lines Fix up datastore handling in ast_do_masquerade(). The
	  code is intended to move any channel datastores from the old
	  channel to the new one. However, it did not use the linked list
	  macros properly to accomplish the task. The existing code would
	  only work if there was only a single datastore on the old
	  channel. ........

	  the priority processing engine in the pbx, a 25-30% speed boost.
	  The two updates used, are, first, to merge the
	  ast_exists_extension() and the ast_spawn_extension() where they
	  are called sequentially in a loop in the code, into a slightly
	  upgraded version of ast_spawn_extension(), with a few extra args;
	  and, second, I modified the substitute_variables_helper_full, so
	  it zeroes out the byte after the evaluated string instead of
	  demanding you pre-zero the buffer; I also went thru the code and
	  removed the code that zeroed this buffer before every call to the
	  substitute_variables_helper_full. The first fix provides about a
	  9% speedup, and the second the rest. These figures come from the
	  'PIPS' benchmark I describe in blogs, conf. reports, etc.

	  saves a file where the semicolon is not escaped. Fixed this; User
	  also wanted comments to be preserved across dialplan save, but
	  this is impossible at this point in time, because comments are
	  not stored in the dialplan. They are 'compiled' out of
	  extensions.conf. The only way to preserve those comments is to
	  use the config file reader/writer that the GUI uses to allow
	  online user edits. extensions.conf is first and foremost, a
	  config file, and is read in by the normal config-file reading
	  routines. Then, it is processed into a dialplan (context/exten
	  structs). (in the case of trunk, tho, no mods needed to be made
	  -- works OK there -- just make sure you use ',' to sep app args!)

	  11 lines Merge the changes from team/russell/iax2_poke_fix and
	  iax2-poke-fix-trunk There was a race condition related to the
	  handling of POKEing peers. Essentially, a reference to a peer is
	  held by the scheduler when there are pending callbacks, but the
	  reference count didn't reflect it. So, it was possible for a peer
	  to hit a reference count of zero and have its destructor begin to
	  be called at the same time that the scheduler thread ran a POKE
	  related callback. If that happened, a crash would likely occur.

	  line closes issue #11086 where a user complains that references

	  that he was referring to empty contexts, which were being

	  checked it out against extensions.conf, and sure enough, empty
	  contexts ARE ok. So, I removed the restriction from AEL. This,
	  though, highlighted a problem with multiple contexts of the same
	  name. This should be OK, also. So, I added the extend keyword to
	  AEL, and it can preceed the 'context' keyword (mixed with
	  'abstract', if nec.). This will turn off the warnings in AEL if
	  the same context name is used 2 or more times. Also, I now call
	  ast_context_find_or_create for contexts now, instead of just
	  ast_context_create; I did this because pbx_config does this. The
	  'extend' keyword thus becomes a statement of intent. AEL can now

	* channels/chan_local.c, doc/tex/localchannel.tex: Add jitterbuffer
	  support for chan_local. To enable it, you use the 'j' option in
	  the Dial command. The 'j' option _must_ be used in conjunction
	  with the 'n' option. This feature will allow you to use the
	  existing jitterbuffer implementation to put a jitterbuffer on
	  incoming SIP calls connecting to Asterisk applications by putting
	  a local channel in the middle.

	  characters exist isn't matched, and the extension isn't matched,

	  is generated, it also generates a single fixed extension that
	  will match a null input. That extension just does a goto to the
	  default extension for that switch. I played with an alternate
	  solution, where I just tack an extra char onto all the patterns
	  and the goto, but not the default case's pattern. Then even a
	  null input will still have at least one char in it. But it made
	  me nervous, having that extra char in , even if that's a pretty

	  10 lines Fix a memory leak that can occur on systems under higher
	  load. The issue is that when events are appended to the master
	  event queue, they use the number of active sessions as a use
	  count so it will know when all active sessions at the time the
	  event happened have consumed it. However, the handling of the
	  number of sessions was not properly synchronized, so the use
	  count was not always correct, causing an event to disappear
	  early, or get stuck in the event queue for forever. (closes issue

	* utils/hashtest2.c: Change the traversal to use ao2_callback()
	  instead of an ao2_iterator. Using ao2_callback() is a much more
	  efficient way of performing an operation on every item in the
	  container. This change makes hashtest2 run in about 25% of the
	  time it ran before on my system. In general, I would say that it
	  makes the most sense to use an ao2_iterator if the operation
	  being performed is going to take a long time and you don't want
	  to keep the container locked while you work with each object.
	  Otherwise, the use of ao2_callback is preferred.

	  kenw, russell Resolve a deadlock that occurs when doing a SIP
	  transfer to parking. I come across this type of deadlock fairly
	  often it seems. It is very important to mind the boundary between
	  the channel driver and the core in respect to the channel lock
	  and the channel-pvt lock. Channel drivers lock to lock the pvt
	  and then the channel once it calls into the core, while the core
	  will do it in the opposite order. The way this is avoided is by
	  having channel drivers either release their pvt lock while
	  calling into the core, or such as in this case, unlocking the pvt
	  just long enough to acquire the channel lock. ........

	  patch creates a new function called update_realtime_member_field,
	  which is a generic function which will allow any one field of a
	  realtime queue member to be updated. This patch only uses this
	  function to update the paused status of a queue member, but it
	  lays the foundation for persisting the state of a realtime member
	  the same way that static members' state is maintained when using
	  the persistentmembers setting ........

	  34 lines Merge changes from team/russell/iax_refcount. This set
	  of changes fixes problems with the handling of iax2_user and
	  iax2_peer objects. It was very possible for a thread to still
	  hold a reference to one of these objects while a reload operation
	  tries to delete them. The fix here is to ensure that all
	  references to these objects are tracked so that they can't go
	  away while still in use. To accomplish this, I used the astobj2
	  reference counted object model. This code has been in one of
	  Luigi Rizzo's branches for a long time and was primarily
	  developed by one of his students, Marta Carbone. I wanted to go
	  ahead and bring this in to 1.4 because there are other problems
	  similar to the ones fixed by these changes, so we might as well
	  go ahead and use the new astobj if we're going to go through all
	  of the work necessary to fix the problems. As a nice side benefit
	  of these changes, peer and user handling got more efficient.
	  Using astobj2 lets us not hold the container lock for peers or
	  users nearly as long while iterating. Also, by changing a define
	  at the top of chan_iax2.c, the objects will be distributed in a
	  hash table, drastically increasing lookup speed in these
	  containers, which will have a very big impact on systems that
	  have a large number of users or peers. The use of the hash table
	  will be made the default in trunk. It is not the default in 1.4
	  because it changes the behavior slightly. Previously, since peers
	  and users were stored in memory in the same order they were
	  specified in the configuration file, you could influence peer and
	  user matching order based on the order they are specified in the
	  configuration. The hash table does not guarantee any order in the
	  container, so this behavior will be going away. It just means
	  that you have to be a little more careful ensuring that peers and
	  users are matched explicitly and not forcing chan_iax2 to have to
	  guess which user is the right one based on secret, host, and
	  access list settings, instead of simply using the username. If
	  you have any questions, feel free to ask on the asterisk-dev
	  list. ........

	  ast_queue_hangup and ast_queue_control were still used directly.
	  Making these changes introduced even more places where the IAX2

	  | 21 lines A fix for two critical problems detected while working
	  with Daniel McKeehan in issue #10184. Upon priority change, the
	  resource list is not NULL terminated when moving an item to the
	  end of the list. This makes Asterisk endlessy loop whenever it
	  needs to read the list. Jids with different resource and priority
	  values, like in Gmail's and GoogleTalk's jabber clients put that
	  problem in evidence. Upon reception of a 'from' attribute with an
	  empty resource string, Asterisk crashes when trying to access the
	  found->cap pointer if the resource list for the given buddy is
	  not empty. This situation is perfectly valid and must be handled.
	  The Gizmoproject's jabber client put that problem in evidence.
	  Also added a few comments in the code as well as a handle for the
	  capabilities from Gmail's jabber client, which are stored in a
	  caps:c tag rather than the usual c tag. Closes issue #10184.

	  device has changed. Then, another thread goes back and calls a
	  callback for the device state provider to find out what the new
	  state is before it can go send it off to whoever cares. I have
	  changed it so that you can include the state that the device has
	  changed to in the first function call from the device state
	  provider. This removes the need to have to call the callback,
	  which locks up critical containers to go find out what the state
	  changed to. This change set changes the "simple" device state
	  providers to use the new method. This includes parking, meetme,
	  and SLA. I have also mostly converted chan_agent in my branch,
	  but still have some more things to think through before
	  presenting the plan for converting channel drivers to ensure all
	  of the right events get generated ...

	  instead of using inboxcount as the core message counting

	  inboxcount and hasvoicemail now use messagecount as their means
	  of determining return values. 3. Added a copy_message function
	  for IMAP storage. Unfortunately I don't have the means to test
	  it, but it seems like a pretty straightforward function. 4.
	  Removed a #ifndef IMAP_STORAGE and matching #endif from
	  leave_voicemail for a couple of reasons. One, we want to support
	  copying mail to multiple IMAP boxes, and two, IMAP was broken
	  because a STORE macro had been moved into this section of code.

	* include/asterisk/linkedlists.h: Fix building res_crypto on
	  systems that init locks with constructors. The problem was that
	  res_crypto now has a RWLIST named "keys". The macro for defining
	  this list defines a function used as a constructor for the list
	  called "init_keys". However, there was another function called
	  init_keys in this module for a CLI command. The fix is just to
	  prepend the generated functions with underscores.

	  28 lines Add some improvements to lock debugging. These changes
	  take effect with DEBUG_THREADS enabled and provide the following:
	  * This will keep track of which locks are held by which thread as
	  well as which lock a thread is waiting for in a thread-local data
	  structure. A reference to this structure is available on the
	  stack in the dummy_start() function, which is the common entry
	  point for all threads. This information can be easily retrieved
	  using gdb if you switch to the dummy_start() stack frame of any
	  thread and print the contents of the lock_info variable. * All of
	  the thread-local structures for keeping track of this lock
	  information are also stored in a list so that the information can
	  be dumped to the CLI using the "core show locks" CLI command.
	  This introduces a little bit of a performance hit as it requires
	  additional underlying locking operations inside of every
	  lock/unlock on an ast_mutex. However, the benefits of having this
	  information available at the CLI is huge, especially considering
	  this is only done in DEBUG_THREADS mode. It means that in most
	  cases where we debug deadlocks, we no longer have to request
	  access to the machine to analyze the contents of ast_mutex_t
	  structures. We can now just ask them to get the output of "core
	  show locks", which gives us all of the information we needed in
	  most cases. I also had to make some additional changes to astmm.c
	  to make this work when both MALLOC_DEBUG and DEBUG_THREADS are
	  enabled. I disabled tracking of one of the locks in astmm.c
	  because it gets used inside the replacement memory allocation
	  routines, and the lock tracking code allocates memory. This
	  caused infinite recursion. ........

	  23 lines Fix some race conditions which have been causing weird
	  problems in chan_iax2. The most notable problem is that people
	  have been seeing storms of VNAK frames being sent due to really
	  old frames mysteriously being in the retransmission queue and
	  never getting removed. It was possible that a dynamic thread got
	  created, but did not acquire its lock before the thread that
	  created it signals it to perform an action. When this happens,
	  the thread will sleep until it hits a timeout, and then get
	  destroyed. So, the action never gets performed and in some cases,
	  means a frame doesn't get transmitted and never gets freed since
	  the scheduler never gets a chance to reschedule transmission.
	  Another less severe race condition is in the handling of a
	  timeout for a dynamic thread. It was possible for it to be
	  acquired to perform at action at the same time that it hit a
	  timeout. When this occurs, whatever action it was acquired for
	  would never get performed. (patch contributed by Mihai and

	  you wrap the lock and unlock calls with sip_pvt_lock and
	  sip_pvt_unlock, you lose the tracing info you would normally get
	  via DETECT_DEADLOCKS; so I turn these two functions into macros
	  when DETECT_DEADLOCKS is called. This way, you get meaningful
	  stuff in the file and func slots in the lock_info struct.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: minor code rearrangements: + place the link
	  field at the beginning of struct sip_pvt, and not somewhere in
	  the middle; + in __sip_reliable_xmit, remove a duplicate
	  assignment, and put the statements in a more logical order (i.e.
	  first copy the payload and associated info, then copy arguments
	  from the caller, then finish initializing the headers...) nothing
	  to backport.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: rename handle_request() to
	  handle_incoming(), as the former was misleading - the function
	  deals with all incoming packets, be them requests or responses.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: move some dialog-only flags to proper
	  variables, namely SIP_NOVIDEO, SIP_DIALOG_ANSWEREDELSEWHERE,
	  SIP_PAGE2_NOTEXT, SIP_PAGE2_OUTGOING_CALL These are seldom used
	  so the diff is relatively small. Note that 'OUTGOING_CALL' is
	  dangerously similar to another dialog flag, 'SIP_OUTGOING', so
	  the description will need to clarify the different meaning of the
	  two. Also note that the description of NOTEXT is a bit unclear -
	  does it mean we don't support it, or 'not requested or not
	  supported' ? On passing fix a comment referring to video instead
	  of text. Finally, mark with XXX a possibly misleading debugging
	  message. (maybe the latter is worth backporting).

	* channels/chan_sip.c: use a function, cli_yesno(), to produce the
	  output Yes or No for CLI lines. This helps maintaining
	  consistency on output, slightly improves readability, and maybe
	  one day will make it easier to translate the output in other
	  languages (though i have a hard time believing that a CLI user
	  who needs 'yes' and 'no' to be translated can actually figure out
	  what he/she is doing!)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: move the two remaining peer flags to proper
	  variables.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: move RT_FROMCONTACT to a proper sip_peer
	  field.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Move some global 'flags' to individual
	  variables. Start putting these variables in a single struct
	  (called 'sip_cfg' for the time being, but it could as well be
	  'global' or some other name) so it is easy, when reading the
	  code, to figure out what they are for. The downside of using
	  struct fields instead of individual global variables is that the
	  compiler cannot tell if there are unused fields. But the
	  advantage of not cluttering the namespace and manilpulating all
	  these variables at once certainly overcome the disadvantagess.
	  Nothing to backport, again.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: minor simplification of a conditional
	  statement

	* channels/chan_sip.c: build the version of sip_tech with no
	  send_digit_begin at load time instead of duplicating the
	  initializer. This should remove the risk of forgetting fields in
	  the initializer.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: remove bit position from description of
	  SIP_* flags. use AST_FORMAT_AUDIO_MASK instead of playing with
	  AST_FORMAT_MAX_AUDIO to determine audio formats. There is a
	  dubious use of AST_FORMAT_MAX_AUDIO in sip_request_call() which
	  surely needs fixing, namely: /* mask request with some set of
	  allowed formats. * XXX this needs to be fixed. * The original
	  code uses AST_FORMAT_AUDIO_MASK, but it is * unclear what to use
	  here. We have global_capabilities, which is * configured from
	  sip.conf, and sip_tech.capabilities, which is * hardwired to all
	  audio formats. */ The latter is possibly something to backport
	  when fixed.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: back on cleaning up the usage of flags. Move
	  together flags used in the same way (e.g. dialog only,
	  dialog-peer, ...) so it will become easier to deal with them in a
	  more systematic way. This is being done in stages so it will be
	  easier to detect breakage, if any should occur.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: more documentation on internal
	  representation of incoming SIP messages. Remove definitions for
	  now-unused flags, and add references to print routines for other
	  flags.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: make register_unref() return NULL so it is
	  easy to cleanup the original pointer while calling the function.
	  on passing add some comments on one of the places where it is
	  used, and explain why it is safe there. again, a no-op for
	  practical purposes.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: add some documentation to auto_congest(),
	  and some dialog_ref/unref (they are a no-op at the moment). Also
	  clean a pointer after freeing memory to avoid dangling
	  references, and write a for() loop in canonical form. In
	  practice, everything in this commit is a no-op.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: more dialog_ref()/dialog_unref() calls

	* channels/chan_sip.c: more dialog_ref()/dialog_unref() calls

	* channels/chan_sip.c: start introducing hooks for reference counts
	  on dialog descriptors. This commit is, for all practical
	  purposes, a no-op, as it only introduces the dialog_ref() and
	  dialog_unref() methods, and uses them in a few places (not all
	  the places where they would be needed). The goal is to start
	  annotating the code with these calls, so the transition to a
	  proper container will be easier. Nothing to backport.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: remove an unused string

	* channels/chan_sip.c: simplify a conditional expression using S_OR

	* channels/chan_sip.c: make use of received= and rport= fields in
	  sip replies. In a nutshell, these fields are used to tell a sip
	  entity the address and port its request came from, and are
	  extremely useful in the presence of NATs, especially with
	  symmetric NATs where STUN is totally ineffective. This patch
	  stores the address and port in the 'ourip' field of the dialog
	  descriptor, so they can be reused in subsequent transactions. As
	  it is, it works well for things like REGISTER requiring
	  authentication, because the second REGISTER request (with auth
	  credentials) will carry the correct address. Maybe it can also be
	  useful, in case of an address change, to do one or both of the
	  following: + propagate the new address to the parent user/peer
	  descriptor so that new dialogs will use the correct address from
	  the beginning. This is trivial to implement, I am just waiting
	  for feedback on this. + re-issue a request in case of an address
	  change. This a lot less trivial, maybe unnecessary, and probably
	  covered by the previous item. I would seriously consider this
	  patch for addition to 1.4 and 1.2. The code is very little
	  intrusive, and it would solve in a correct way the nat traversal
	  problems for which externip/externaddr/stunaddr are only a
	  partial and expensive workaround.

	  The AST_DEVMODE macro was never defined so the majority of
	  ast_backtrace never attempted compilation. The makefile now
	  defines AST_DEVMODE if configure was run with --enable-dev-mode.
	  Also, changes were made to acccomodate 64 bit systems in
	  ast_backtrace. Thanks to qwell, kpfleming, and Corydon76 for
	  their roles in allowing me to get this committed ........

	  Queue() can act properly depending on which strategy is used. If
	  the strategy is roundrobin, rrmemory, or ringall, we want to ring
	  each phone once before moving on in the dialplan. However, if any
	  other strategy is used, we will only ring one phone since it
	  cannot be guaranteed that a different phone will ring on
	  subsequent attempts to ring a phone. As a side effect of this,
	  the QUEUE_MEMBER_COUNT dialplan function now just reads the
	  membercount variable instead of traversing through the member
	  list to figure out how many members there are. Special thanks to

	* channels/chan_sip.c: add two missing entries in the replica of
	  the sip_tech that does not use DTMF BEGIN frames. 1.4 seems
	  correct (it does not have the two fields). However, as this bug
	  shows, the current way of creating the sip_tech replica is too
	  error-prone, one can easily forget to update one of the two
	  entries. Perhaps it would be better to create sip_tech_info
	  expliclty at module load, by doing sip_tech_info = sip_tech;

	  20070720__core_debug_by_file.patch uploaded by bbryant (license
	  36) (with some modifications by me) Tested by: russell, bbryant
	  This set of changes introduces the ability to set the core debug
	  or verbose levels on a per-file basis. Interestingly enough, in
	  1.4, you have the ability to set core debug for a single file,
	  but that functionality was accidentally lost in the conversion of
	  the CLI commands to the new format. This patch improves upon what
	  was in 1.4 by letting you set it for more than 1 file, and by
	  also supporting verbose. *** Janitor Project *** This patch also
	  introduces a new macro, ast_verb(), which is similar to
	  ast_debug(). Setting the per file verbose value only works for
	  messages that use this macro. Converting existing uses of
	  ast_verbose() can be done like: if (option_debug > 2)
	  ast_verbose(VERBOSE_PREFIX_3 "Something useful\n"); ...
	  ast_verb(3, "Something useful\n");

2007-07-23 03:10 +0000 [r76313-76467]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add some documentation on the sipregistry
	  states and the handling of the sip_register structures. This
	  commit only changes comments and whitespace.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: add a bit of comments on internal functions.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: rewrite "sip show {channels|subscriptions}"
	  CLI handler using the new-style cli format. No functional
	  changes, nothing to backport.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Make sip_destroy() return NULL so the caller
	  can do things like foo = sip_destroy(foo); and reduce the chance
	  of bugs due to dangling pointers. Also remove a duplicate
	  prototype for the function. nothing to backport.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: add two comment blocks, one on reusing
	  nonces, and one on the handling of an 'authpeer' local variable.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: comment and slightly restructure
	  handle_request() in the part that handles responses, so that
	  there is a common exit point. Mark two places where probably we
	  could return -1 instead of 0 to report an error to the caller.
	  (change triggered by investigations on how the 'SIP_PKT_IGNORE'
	  field was used). nothing to backport from this commit

	* channels/chan_sip.c: remove unused argument from
	  handle_invite_replaces(), and also leftover SIP_PKT_* stuff from
	  the previous commit.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Cleanup of flags used in struct sip_request,
	  moving them to individual variables. Apart from SIP_PKT_IGNORE
	  which was used a zillion times, the other two are used seldom. On
	  passing: - move the arrays to the end of struct sip_request, so a
	  (small) buffer overflow is less likely to overwrite the other
	  fields; - note that the 'ignore' argument to
	  handle_invite_replaces() is not used and should be removed (will
	  be done in a separate commit). Nothing to backport in this
	  change.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: move two per-packet flags to proper
	  variables.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: minor clarification on the usage of SIP_*
	  flags. Also correct some items that were misclassified.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: document the way sipdebug works, and
	  implement it through variables and not flags. NOTE: The old
	  behaviour (preserved in this commit) is that if sipdebug is set
	  in the config file, it can only be disabled by reloading the
	  config. I am not sure if this is accidental or voluntary, but it
	  is really unconvenient and I think it should be handled in the
	  same way as other options i.e. consider requests from the config
	  file or the cli (or the command line) to be fully equivalent and
	  act on the same status variable.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: move the SIP_REALTIME flag to a field in the
	  user/peer structure.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Add a note to document how the temporary
	  'pvt' should be initialized before using it. I am unclear on the
	  details right now so i hope someone can comment more. The obvious
	  (and lazy) approach would be to bzero() all of it (except for the
	  string pool), but isn't that too much work ? Feedback wanted
	  here...

2007-07-21 14:39 +0000 [r76296]  Joshua Colp <jcolp@digium.com>

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, configure,
	  include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in, configure.ac, main/utils.c: Add
	  support for using /dev/urandom to get random numbers on systems
	  that support it.

2007-07-21 09:35 +0000 [r76229-76279]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: whoops... was setting needdestroy on the
	  wrong dialog. (spotted by a diff with my own branch)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: more two more flags to proper variables:
	  ALREADYGONE and NEEDDESTROY.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: use explicit variables for things that don't
	  need to be stored in ast_flags. First victim is 'SIP_NO_HISTORY'
	  replaced by a 'do_history' field in the sip_pvt structure.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Use ast_str_append() instead of
	  ast_build_string() to construct the sdp messages. Overall the
	  code is slightly more readable (because the string is fully
	  described by a single pointer), and more efficient (because the
	  length is stored explicitly so you don't need to do strlen()). (I
	  have been using this code for almost a year now.) I wish we had
	  infix string operators to do this sort of things! Nothing to
	  backport from this change.

2007-07-21 01:25 +0000 [r76224]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: We have two 'technology' descriptors for a
	  SIP channel, so define and use a macro to determine whether we
	  are pointing to one of them, so when one goes away (or a new one
	  appears) we don't have to touch all the code.

2007-07-21 01:01 +0000 [r76221]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Enhance NAT support
	  as discussed on the -dev list, i.e.: + extensive documentation
	  changes both in sip.conf.sample and in the source; + allow
	  "externip" and "externhost" to include a port number as well; +
	  allow "bindaddr" to have a port number (making bindport
	  unnecessary, even though it is still present for backward
	  compatibility); + introduce the new "stunaddr" parameter to
	  specify an STUN server to be used from the main SIP socket; +
	  extend the "sip show settings" output to show all the above.
	  Internally: + change related data structures from struct in_addr
	  to struct sockaddr_in to store the port numbers as well; +
	  reorganize ast_sip_ouraddrfor() (should also be renamed to
	  sip_ouraddrfor() because it is not a generic API, though it might
	  become so if called with a socket as an additional argument, in
	  which case it can be moved elsewhere). As mentioned in the
	  documentation, media sessions still do not use STUN so the port
	  numbers may still be incorrect when Asterisk is behind a NAT On
	  passing, some of the debugging messages printing media addresses
	  are probably using the wrong values, but this will be
	  checked/fixed in a subsequent commit if needed. Part of the
	  following chunk in the function that handles a "sip reload" is
	  probably needed on previous versions as well, to avoid leaking
	  the memory used for the "localaddr" list: @@ -17244,13 +17274,17

2007-07-20 15:06 +0000 [r76034-76037]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Don't use a field size for the last argument
	  of printf format, because in this case the string is left-aligned
	  and it is not truncated anyways. Omitting the field size prevents
	  the generation of trailing whitespace, which makes the string fit
	  in smaller windows.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Extend the 'network settings' section with
	  indication on the localnet settings (requires the change in SVN
	  76034), and also give an indication on whether/why/how the
	  remapping of addresses in SIP message is done or not. I think
	  this is especially useful for debugging the configuration, as the
	  address remapping depends on a combination of at least 3
	  parameters (localnet, externhost, externip) and successful DNS
	  lookup. An example of the output of this section is below:
	  Network Settings: --------------------------- SIP address
	  remapping: Enabled using externhost Externhost: foo.dyndns.net
	  Externip: 80.64.128.23:0 Externrefresh: 10 Internal IP:
	  12.34.56.78:5060 Localnet: 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
	  10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 I leave to the community the judgement if the
	  above info is a useful addition for 1.4. It is not a bugfix, but
	  it is neither a new feature, only a useful diagnostic tool. Note
	  that I would like to move there also the bindaddress/port
	  information, in the usual addr:port format e.g. Bindaddress:
	  0.0.0.0:5060 so that network information is all in one place.

	* include/asterisk/acl.h, main/acl.c: expose struct ast_ha so
	  external code can do things such as printing it (e.g. chan_sip.c
	  in a subsequent commit). Obviously exposing the internals of a
	  data structure is far from ideal (especially in a case like this
	  where the implementation is very inefficient and will need to be
	  changed at some point). On the other hand, it was also unclear
	  what additional APIs should we provide instead, and because
	  exposing the stucture has no impact on source and binary
	  compatibility, this seemed to me the best option at this time.

	  version of ast_flags (ast_flags64), and 64-bit versions of the
	  test-flag, set-flag, etc. macros, and an app_parse_options64
	  routine, and I use these in app_dial alone, to eliminate the
	  30-option limit it had grown to meet. There is room now for 32
	  more options and flags. I was heavily tempted to implement some
	  of the other ideas that were presented, but this solution does
	  not intro any new versions of dial, doesn't have a different API,
	  has a minimal/zero impact on code outside of dial, and doesn't
	  seriously (I hope) affect the code structure of dial. It's the
	  best I can think of right now. My goal was NOT to rewrite dial. I
	  leave that to a future, coordinated effort.

	* main/acl.c: comment out some terribly expensive debugging code in
	  the body of ast_apply_ha()

	* channels/chan_sip.c: print more of the network settings
	  (externip, externhost etc.) in the "sip show settings" cli
	  output. I have put these in a separate section, probably even
	  bindaddr and SIP port should go there. There are more things to
	  add here e.g. localnet and so on.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: document the use of externip, externhost and
	  other nat-related options, as well as the handling of the sip
	  socket.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: ast_sip_ouraddrfor() never fails, so make it
	  void and remove the code that would never be called.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: portability fix: use %f instead of %lf when
	  printing double. The l is useless.

2007-07-17 14:32 +0000 [r75365-75379]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* include/asterisk/config.h, main/config.c: Introduce
	  ast_parse_arg() , a generic function to parse strings in a
	  consistent way. This is meant to replace the custom code which is
	  repeated all over the place in the various files when parsing
	  config files, CLI entries and other string information. Right now
	  the code supports parsing int32, uint32 and sockaddr_in with
	  optional default values and bound checks. It contains minimal
	  error checking, but that can be easily extended as the need
	  arises. Being a new API i am introducing this only in trunk,
	  though I believe that once the interface has been ironed out it
	  might become a worthwhile addition to 1.4 as well - basically,
	  the first time we will need to fix a piece of argument parsing
	  code, we might as well bring in this change and use the new API
	  instead.

	* apps/app_minivm.c: Initialize a variable to avoid a warning when
	  the compiler (and/or the optimization level) may think it is used
	  uninitialized. The code was indeed correct, but unfortunately the
	  result of some compiler checks such as -Wunused and
	  -Wuninitialized depends heavily on the optimization level.

2007-07-13 16:22 +0000 [r75034]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* include/asterisk/rtp.h, main/rtp.c: Small improvement to the STUN
	  support so it can be used by sockets other than RTP ones. The
	  main change is a new API function in main/rtp.c (see there for a
	  description) int ast_stun_request(int s, struct sockaddr_in *dst,
	  const char *username, struct sockaddr_in *answer) which can be
	  used to send an STUN request on a socket, and optionally wait for
	  a reply and store the STUN_MAPPED_ADDRESS into the 'answer'
	  argument (obviously, the version that waits for a reply is
	  blocking, but this is no different from DNS resolutions).
	  Internally there are minor modifications to let
	  stun_handle_packet() be somewhat configurable on how to parse the
	  body of responses. At the moment i am not committing any change
	  to the clients, but adding STUN client support is extremely
	  simple, e.g. chan_sip.c could do something like this: + add a
	  variable to store the stun server address; static struct
	  sockaddr_in stunaddr = { 0, }; /*!< stun server address */ + add
	  code to parse a config file of the form
	  "stunaddr=my.stun.server.org:3478" (not shown for brevity); +
	  right after binding the main sip socket, talk to the stun server
	  to determine the externally visible address if
	  (stunaddr.sin_addr.s_addr != 0) ast_stun_request(sipsock,
	  &stunaddr, NULL, &externip); so now 'externip' is set with the
	  externally visible address. so it is really trivial. Similarly
	  ast_stun_request could be called when creating the RTP socket
	  (possibly adding a struct sockaddr_in field in the struct ast_rtp
	  to store the externalip).

	  choking on floating point numbers, I'm adding this update to
	  round out (no pun intended) and make this FP-capable version of
	  the Expr2 stuff interoperate better with previous integer-only
	  usage, by providing Functions syntax, with 20 builtin functions
	  for floating pt to integer conversions, and some general floating
	  point math routines that might commonly be used also. Along with
	  this, I made it so if a function was not a builtin, it will try
	  and find it in the ast_custom_function list, and if found,
	  execute it and collect the results. Thus, you can call system
	  functions like CDR(), CHANNEL(), etc, from within $\[..\] exprs,
	  without having to wrap them in $\{...\} (curly brace) notation.
	  Did a valgrind on the standalone and made sure there's no mem
	  leaks. Looks good. Updated the docs, too.

	* main/Makefile: Make sure that we properly recurse in
	  subdirectories to check dependencies for libraries. Because these
	  targets (e.g. minimime/libmmime.a) are real ones, declaring them
	  .PHONY would cause them to be rebuilt every time (see e.g. SVN
	  64355). As a workaround I am using the following CHECK_SUBDIR
	  target: CHECK_SUBDIR: # do nothing, just make sure that we
	  recurse in the subdir/ minimime/libmmime.a: CHECK_SUBDIR @cd
	  minimime && $(MAKE) libmmime.a which seems to do a better job
	  than .PHONY (probably because .PHONY forces the rebuild even if
	  the recursive make does not think it is necessary). If this turns
	  out to be the correct approach, we can then merge it back into
	  1.4

	  keep better track of the number of messages that a mailbox
	  currently has. A description of the changes: 1. Changed the
	  "updated" field of the vm_state struct to act more as a binary
	  semaphore than a counting semaphore, since its current
	  implementation made the inboxcount function not work properly.
	  This change falls in line with a change made by UPenn with their
	  IMAP setup and helps to sync our changes with theirs. 2.
	  Eliminated some redundant calls to get_vm_state_by_mailbox inside
	  leave_voicemail 3. Use the play_folder variable to keep track of
	  the number of old and new messages in a mailbox as the messages
	  are deleted 4. Added an increment to the number of new messages
	  that was not there previously in the leave_voicemail function

	  that it can update subscriptions to that extension. A pointer to

	  needs a NOTIFY sent. However, there was no locking done to ensure

	  received to a BYE outside of the block that checks for FLAG_FATAL

	  with the reliability set to XMIT_CRITICAL when the original
	  packet is transmitted. A BYE is always sent with it set to

	  12 lines In ast_channel_make_compatible(), just return if the

	  paths that call this function on a pair of channels multiple

	  The reason is that codec_g729a will unregister itself from the
	  list of available translators will all licenses are in use. So,
	  the first time the function got called, the right translation
	  path was allocated. However, the second time it got called, the

	  16 lines This bug has been hanging over my head ever since I
	  wrote this SLA code. Every time I tried to go debug it by adding
	  some debug output, the behavior would change. It turns out I
	  wasn't crazy. I had the following piece of code: if (remove)
	  AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT(...); Well, AST_LIST_REMOVE_CURRENT was
	  not wrapped in braces, so my conditional statement didn't do much
	  good at all. It always ran at least all of the macro minus the
	  first statement, so I was seeing list entries magically disappear
	  when they weren't supposed to. After many hours of debugging, I
	  have come to this extremely irritating fix. :) (issues #9581,

	  include/asterisk/pbx.h, apps/app_queue.c, main/asterisk.c: Merge
	  major changes to the way device state is passed around Asterisk.
	  The two places that cared about device states were app_queue and
	  the hint code in pbx.c. The changes include converting it to use
	  the Asterisk event system, as well as other efficiency
	  improvements. * app_queue: This module used to register a
	  callback into devicestate.c to monitor device state changes. Now,
	  it is just a subscriber to Asterisk events with the type, device
	  state. * pbx.c hints: Previously, the device state processing
	  thread in devicestate.c would call ast_hint_state_changed() each
	  time the state of a device changed. Then, that code would go
	  looking for all the hints that monitor that device, and call
	  their callbacks. All of this blocked the device state processing
	  thread. Now, the hint code is a subscriber of Asterisk events
	  with the type, device state. Furthermore, when this code receives
	  a device state change event, it queues it up to be processed by
	  another thread so that it doesn't block one of the event
	  processing threads.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Remove 80 bytes in the iax2_registry struct
	  that weren't being used

	  new disposition, NULL, is at the lowest level, and the
	  disposition get init'd to NULL. Then, next up is FAIL, and next
	  up is BUSY, then NOANSWER, then ANSWERED. All the related set

	  greater than what's already there. This gives the intended
	  effect. So, if all the targets are busy, you'd get BUSY for the
	  call disposition. If all get BUSY, but one, and that one rings is
	  not answered, you get NOANSWER. If by some freak of nature, the
	  NULL value doesn't get overridden, then the disp2str routine will

	* funcs/func_enum.c, include/asterisk/enum.h, main/enum.c: Add two
	  new dialplan functions: ENUMQUERY and ENUMRESULT. These functions
	  allow you to initiate an ENUM query using ENUMQUERY, and then
	  access the details of all of the results using ENUMRESULT.
	  Previously, if you wanted to access multiple results, Asterisk
	  would have to do a new DNS lookup every time. (patch by bbryant)

	* pbx/pbx_dundi.c: Make sure that DUNDIRESULT is given an ID.

	  17 lines Fix YADB (Yet Another DTMF Bug) ((C) Russell Bryant,
	  2007, TM, Patent Pending). This set of changes came from a
	  debugging session I had with Dwayne Hubbard. When he called into
	  his home FXO, ran the Echo application, and pressed a digit, the
	  digit would be echoed back and would never end. This is fixed,
	  along with a couple other little improvements. * When chan_zap is
	  in the middle of playing a digit to a channel, it feeds back null
	  frames, not voice frames. So, I have modified ast_read to check
	  the timing on emulated DTMF when it receives null frames, in
	  addition to where it was doing this on voice frames. * Make a
	  tweak to setting the duration on emulated DTMF digits. If there
	  was no duration specified, it set it to be the minimum, instead
	  of the default. * Instead of timing the emulated digits off of
	  the number of samples in audio frames that pass through, just use
	  time values. Now there is no code in this section that assumes
	  8kHz audio. ........

	  20 lines Merge changes from team/russell/inband_dtmf ... Fix some
	  issues related to generating inband DTMF. There are two changes
	  here: 1) The list of DTMF tones in the senddigit_begin() function
	  explicitly specified 100ms of the tone followed by 100ms of
	  silence. This really broke things with the way that Asterisk now
	  wants complete control over when the digit begins and ends. So,
	  regardless of what Asterisk really wanted to do, this was going
	  to play out the tone at the length it wanted to. This caused
	  various problems like DTMF translation to inband to be extremely
	  unreliable. The list of tones has been changed so that the
	  correct DTMF tone is played indefinitely until Asterisk tells it
	  to stop. 2) ast_write() had to be modified to let a DTMF_END
	  frame get processed even when a generator is present. This is how
	  the tone will finally get stopped. (issues #8944, #9250, #9348,
	  maybe others. Thanks to mdu113 from #8944 for the testing and
	  feedback!) ........

	  team/russell/events This set of changes introduces a new generic
	  event API for use within Asterisk. I am still working on a way
	  for events to be shared between servers, but this part is ready
	  and can already be used inside of Asterisk. This set of changes
	  introduces the first use of the API, as well. I have restructured
	  the way that MWI (message waiting indication) is handled. It is
	  now event based instead of polling based. For example, if there
	  are a bunch of SIP phones subscribed to mailboxes, then chan_sip
	  will not have to constantly poll the mailboxes for changes.
	  app_voicemail will generate events when changes occur. See
	  UPGRADE.txt and CHANGES for some more information on the effects
	  of these changes from the user perspective. For developer
	  information, see the text in include/asterisk/event.h. As always,
	  additional feedback is welcome on the asterisk-dev mailing list.

	  intitiate a DUNDi query from the dialplan. Then, DUNDIRESULT will
	  let you find out how many results there are, and access each one
	  without having to the query again.

	* include/asterisk/lock.h: Remove a message that goes to LOG_ERROR
	  that's not really an error.

	* configs/queues.conf.sample, CHANGES, apps/app_queue.c: Add a

	  control the minimum amount of time between queue announcements
	  for use when the caller's queue position changes frequently.

	  ........ r62218 | russell | 2007-04-27 16:10:51 -0500 (Fri, 27
	  Apr 2007) | 11 lines Fix a weird problem where when a caller
	  talking to someone sitting behind an agent channel sent a digit,
	  the digit would be played to the agent for forever. This is
	  because chan_agent always returned -1 from its send_digit_begin
	  and _end callbacks. This non-zero return value indicates to the
	  Asterisk core that it would like an inband DTMF generator put on
	  the channel. However, this is the wrong thing to do. It should
	  *always* return 0, instead. When the digit begin and end
	  functions are called on the proxied channel, the underlying
	  channel will indicate whether inband DTMF is needed or not, and
	  the generator will be put on that one, and not the Agent channel.

	* CHANGES: Note the bridge manager action and application in the
	  CHANGES file.

	* res/res_features.c: Merge changes from team/russell/issue_5841:
	  This patch adds a "Bridge" Manager action, as well as a "Bridge"
	  dialplan application. The manager action will allow you to steal
	  two active channels in the system and bridge them together. Then,
	  the one that did not hang up will continue in the dialplan. Using
	  the application will bridge the calling channel to an arbitrary
	  channel in the system. Whichever channel does not hang up here
	  will continue in the dialplan, as well. This patch has been
	  touched by a bunch of people over the course of a couple years.
	  Please forgive me if I have missed your name in the history of
	  things. The most recent patch came from issue #5841, but there is
	  also a reference to an earlier version of this patch from issue
	  #4297. The people involved in writing and/or reviewing the code
	  include at least: twisted, mflorrel, heath1444, davetroy,
	  tim_ringenbach, moy, tmancill, serge-v, and me. There are also
	  positive test reports from many people.

	* main/dial.c, include/asterisk/dial.h: Add an option to the dial
	  API for playing music instead of ringing to the caller. I started
	  this for use with SLA but ended up deciding not to use it.
	  However, there is no reason not to put this part in, anyway.

	  include the 4 extra args everyone got. Not much info there, as
	  the config file evidently does not allow amaflags, or accountcode
	  settings; and the pvt's exten doesn't sound like what we need in
	  the cdr, either.

	  13 lines To be able to achieve the things that we would like to
	  achieve with the Asterisk GUI project, we need a fully functional
	  HTTP interface with access to the Asterisk manager interface. One
	  of the things that was intended to be a part of this system, but
	  was never actually implemented, was the ability for the GUI to be
	  able to upload files to Asterisk. So, this commit adds this in
	  the most minimally invasive way that we could come up with. A lot
	  of work on minimime was done by Steve Murphy. He fixed a lot of
	  bugs in the parser, and updated it to be thread-safe. The ability
	  to check permissions of active manager sessions was added by
	  Dwayne Hubbard. Then, hacking this all together and do doing the
	  modifications necessary to the HTTP interface was done by me.

	  16 lines Fix a few problems with SLA. (issue #9459, reported by
	  francesco_r, fixed by me) * The original behavior was that if one
	  station put a call on hold, another one picked it up, and then
	  hung up, the code would still consider the call on hold by the
	  first station, so the trunk would not be hung up. However, to
	  better comply with what most people seem to expect it to behave,
	  it will now hang up the trunk. * Fix a problem with "barge=no".
	  This was only intended to prevent people from joining calls that
	  are in progress. However, it also prevented other people from

	  instead of a "null frame". This will cause Asterisk to hangup the
	  call instead of keep trying whatever it was doing. Under normal
	  conditions, this function would *never* be called. However, the
	  author of this patch says an error will occur that will cause it
	  to get called every 100 thousand calls or so. When this does
	  happen, it puts the channel in a loop that eventually brings down
	  the system. So, hangup up the call is certainly a better
	  alternative. (issue #8286, john) ........

	  * Originally, I put in the documentation that only Zap interfaces
	  would be supported on the trunk side. However, after a discussion
	  with Qwell, we came up with a way to make IP trunks work as well,
	  using some things already in Asterisk. So, here it is, this now
	  officially supports IP trunks. * Update the SLA documentation to
	  reflect how to setup IP trunks. * Add a section in sla.txt that
	  describes how to set up an SLA system with voicemail. * Simplify
	  the way DTMF passthrough is handled in MeetMe. * Fix a bug that
	  exposed itself when using a Local channel on the trunk side in
	  SLA. The station's channel needs to be passed to the dial API
	  when dialing the trunk. * Change a WARNING message to DEBUG in
	  channel.h. This message is of no use to users. ........

	  write to an alert pipe for the flag to be handled. Then, there is
	  another thread that is monitoring for these flags. If being run
	  in console mode, it is just the main thread. If Asterisk is in
	  the background, a thread is created to do it. ........

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Make the hashing function calculate

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: Merge team/russell/iax2_performance. There
	  is not a large amount of code here and the changes are not very
	  invasive. However, they should significantly improve performance
	  of chan_iax2 under load. IAX2 media frames only carry the
	  *source* call number. So, when one arrives, the correct session
	  that it is a part of has to be matched on IP address, port
	  number, and call number, instead of just a call number. Had these
	  frames carried the *destination* call number, this would not be
	  an issue, because that would be a unique identifier that would
	  make it easy to immediately identify the correct session. The way
	  that chan_iax2 did this matching was extremely inefficient. It
	  starts at the first available call number and traverses each call
	  number sequentially, locking and unlocking a mutex for each one,
	  to try to match against it. It would do this regardless of
	  whether the call number was in use or not. So, for a call with a
	  local call number of 25000, every single incoming media frame
	  would require a traversal that required 25000 mutex lock and
	  unlock operations. (Note that the max call number is about 32k).
	  I have introduced a hash table of active IAX2 calls to improve
	  this lookup process. The hash is done on the IP address, port
	  number, and call number. So, for the previous example, a few
	  lock/unlock operations may be done versus 25000 for each frame.

	* CHANGES: Note that the entries in the CHANGES file only list
	  functionality changes

	* CHANGES: Add GetConfigJSON to the CHANGES file.

	  8 lines The IMAP storage code uses the same code to build the
	  email that is used when voicemail is sent via email using
	  something like sendmail. In the patch from bug 8033 to fix
	  various IMAP storage problems, the line endings in the email file
	  were changed in the code from "\n" to "\r\n". However, this
	  breaks sending regular voicemail to email. So, this change
	  conditionally sets line endings to "\r\n" only if IMAP_STORAGE is
	  enabled. (issue #9128, patch by jarjarbinks, modified by me to
	  not break IMAP storage) ........

	* main/manager.c: Introduce a new manager action, GetConfigJSON,
	  which is intended to improve performance of the GUI. This encodes
	  the configuration into the JSON format in a manager header,
	  "JSON: ". The encoded information can be directly used as a
	  javascript object, so no parsing is needed. For large
	  configuration files, this can greatly improve loading times in
	  the GUI. Furthermore, the encoding takes up a lot less space when
	  being transmitted than the other alternatives. (Inspired by
	  discussion with Pari) Here is an example of what you get:
	  http://localhost:8088/asterisk/rawman?action=getconfigjson&filename=users.conf
	  Response: Success JSON:
	  {"general":["hasvoicemail=yes"],"6000":["fullname=russell","secret=1234"]}

	  the SLA code event driven instead of having to act in a lot of
	  busy loops while dialing things to wait for state changes. This
	  makes the code more efficient and readable at the same time. * I
	  have implemented a couple of new features. The first is inbound
	  trunk ringing timeouts. This is an option that defines how long
	  to let an incoming call on a trunk to ring. * I have also
	  implemented ring timeouts for stations. They may be specified for
	  the entire station, meaning it is how long to let the station
	  ring before giving up. You can also specify a ring timeout for a
	  specific trunk on a station. So, you can say that you only want a
	  specific station to ring 5 seconds if it is line1 ringing, but
	  otherwise, there is no timeout. ........

	  23 lines Merge the changes from the /team/group/vldtmf_fixup
	  branch. The main bug being addressed here is a problem introduced
	  when two SIP channels using SIP INFO dtmf have their media
	  directly bridged. So, when a DTMF END frame comes into Asterisk
	  from an incoming INFO message, Asterisk would try to emulate a
	  digit of some length by first sending a DTMF BEGIN frame and
	  sending a DTMF END later timed off of incoming audio. However,
	  since there was no audio coming in, the DTMF_END was never
	  generated. This caused DTMF based features to no longer work. To
	  fix this, the core now knows when a channel doesn't care about
	  DTMF BEGIN frames (such as a SIP channel sending INFO dtmf). If
	  this is the case, then Asterisk will not emulate a digit of some
	  length, and will instead just pass through the single DTMF END
	  event. Channel drivers also now get passed the length of the
	  digit to their digit_end callback. This improves SIP INFO support
	  even further by enabling us to put the real digit duration in the
	  INFO message instead of a hard coded 250ms. Also, for an incoming
	  INFO message, the duration is read from the frame and passed into
	  the core instead of just getting ignored. (issue #8597, maybe
	  others...) ........

	* include/asterisk/strings.h: As the comment in the diff says:
	  AST_INLINE_API() is a macro that takes a block of code as an
	  argument. Using preprocessor #directives in the argument is not
	  supported by all compilers, and it is a bit of an obfuscation
	  anyways, so avoid it. As a workaround, define a macro that
	  produces either its argument or nothing, and use that instead of
	  #ifdef/#endif within the argument to AST_INLINE_API().

	* main/rtp.c: in the interest of portability, avoid using %zd when
	  all we need is to print is an integer that fits in 16 bits.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: sizeof() is compatible with format %d so

	  them out. The AST_PROG_LD is a long standing isse, there were
	  attempts to fix it in the past but probably not enough has been
	  copied to acinclude.m4, and i had forgotten about it because i
	  commented out this call in configure.ac long ago

	* configure.ac: Add check for backtrace support on platforms that
	  do not have it natively. Part of it leaked in in a previous
	  commit.

	* configure.ac: remove a useless (and harmful on some platforms)
	  -lnsl from IKSEMEL_LIB. Actually i am not even sure whether
	  -lgcrypt -lgpg-error are needed.

	* configure.ac: simplify checking for zaptel version and location
	  (for linux, this is functionally equivalent to the previous
	  method; for FreeBSD, it re-adds inspection in $PREFIX/zaptel.h).
	  Please wait to regenerate the "configure" file as i have another
	  few pending changes to configure.ac Not applicable to 1.4 until
	  acinclude.m4 is also updated.

	* apps/app_sms.c: - use the standard option parsing routines; -
	  document existing but undocumented parameters to send a message
	  (untested but unchanged; - ad a new option p(N) to set the
	  initial message delay to N ms so this can be adapted from the
	  dialplan to various countries;

	* main/manager.c: Replace ast_build_string with ast_str_*(). On
	  passing remove presumably duplicate code to generate the message
	  for the manager_hooks: in the previous version, the message was
	  almost the same as the one sent to regular sessions, with the
	  exception of the empty line at the end, and a few (presumably
	  unintentional) differences e.g. timestamps, debugging, and
	  lowercase headers for "event" and "privilege". now we reuse the
	  same message as before.

	* funcs/func_realtime.c: replace ast_build_string() with
	  ast_str_*(). Unless i am very mistaken, function_realtime_read()
	  was broken in that it would always return an empty string
	  (because ast_build_string() advanced the pointer to the end of
	  the string, and there was no reference to the initial value. This
	  commit should fix this problem.

	* main/manager.c, main/logger.c, main/utils.c,
	  include/asterisk/strings.h, main/cli.c: simplify the
	  ast_dynamic_str_*.... routines by renaming them to ast_str ...
	  and putting the struct ast_threadstorage pointer into the struct
	  ast_str. This makes the code a lot more readable. At this point
	  we can use these routines also to replace ast_build_string().

	* include/asterisk/utils.h, main/utils.c,
	  include/asterisk/strings.h, include/asterisk/threadstorage.h:
	  move the dynamic string support in a better place i.e. string.h
	  While doing this, add a bit of documentation, and slightly extend
	  the functionality as follows: + a max_len of -1 means that we
	  take whatever the current size is, and never try to extend the
	  buffer; + add support for alloca()-ted dynamic strings, which is
	  very useful for all cases where we do an ast_build_string() now.
	  Next step is to simplify the interface by using shorter names
	  (e.g. ast_str as a prefix) and removing the _thread variant of
	  the functions by saving the threadstorage reference into the
	  struct ast_str. This can be done by overloading the 'type' field.
	  Finally, I will do my best to remove the convoluted interface
	  that results from trying to support platforms without va_copy().

	* main/pbx.c: clean up function manager_show_dialplan_helper()

	  (idaction), and mark some places where the behaviour is not what
	  we would expect (e.g. an empty context is reported as an error
	  same as a non-existent one). Given that this function is not in

	* main/manager.c: make sure the argument to ast_malloc() is > 0.
	  Long explaination: The behaviour of the underlying malloc(0)
	  differs depending on the operating system. Some return NULL (SysV
	  behaviour); some still allocate a small chunk of memory and
	  return a valid pointer (e.g. traditional BSD); some (e.g. FreeBSD
	  6.x) return a non-null pointer that causes a memory fault if
	  used, even just for reading. Given the above variety, better

	  being a problem is pretty small, but still possible. For example,
	  if the CLI command to list the registrations was called at the

	  was getting destroyed and rebuilt, a crash could occur. In
	  passing, go ahead and convert this list to use the linked list
	  macros. ........

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: chan_iax2 has an extremely large function,
	  socket_process(), to handle incoming frames. The function, before
	  this commit, was roughly 1400 lines long. So, I am working on
	  breaking this up into functions so that the code is easier to
	  follow and debug. Also, I will be committing these changes in
	  chunks as I do them to ease tracking down any potentially
	  introduced problems. Break out roughly 150 lines from
	  socket_process() and introduce a new function,
	  socket_process_meta() which handles the parsing of an incoming
	  meta frame. Also, restructure some of this code a bit to reduce
	  the deep nesting that was in this code.

	* channels/chan_iax2.c: - Fix a few spelling mistakes - Use
	  sizeof() to pass an array size to a function - Use a single bit
	  for a variable in the chan_iax2_pvt stuct since that is all it
	  needs. - Add some comments about the iaxs, iaxl, and lastused
	  arrays.

	* main/manager.c: remove duplicated code to start the server

	  As a bonus, now we can restart the session on a different port
	  just reloading the module. On passing, fix a bug in the handling

	  support, as described in
	  http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-dev/2006-December/025213.html
	  In detail, this commit does the following: b) change the function
	  get_input() to use fread() instead of read() to collect the data.
	  One can still do the ast_wait_for_input() on the original
	  descriptor returned by accept(). c) change the function
	  send_string() to work on the FILE *. As a side effect, this
	  change now really guarantees that we don't spend more than
	  "writetimeout" milliseconds on each line sent. d) modify the
	  function action_command() so that it creates a temporary file
	  descriptor to be passed to ast_cli_command(), and then read back
	  the data from the temp file and write it to the output with
	  send_string(). The code is similar to what is done in
	  generic_http_callback() to support AMI-over-HTTP.

	* include/asterisk/http.h, main/http.c: Make externally visible
	  some generic code useful to create and implement services over
	  tcp and/or tcp-tls. This commit is nothing more than moving
	  structure definitions (and documentation) from main/http.c to
	  include/asterisk/http.h (temporary location until we find a
	  better place), and removing the 'static' qualifier from
	  server_root() and server_start(). The name change (adding the
	  ast_ prefix as a minimum, and then possibly a more meaningful
	  name) is postponed to future commits. Does not apply to other
	  versions of asterisk.

	  be called directly.

	* main/utils.c: Go ahead and make this write unconditional. Making
	  it conditional is more work in both the append and non-append
	  modes. Also, always truncating the partial write makes the
	  behavior of the function more consistent, where in any type of

	* main/manager.c: don't use outputstr in the struct mansession,
	  it's just an extra allocation on a path where we have way too
	  many already. Unfortunately the AMI-over-HTTP requires multiple

	  to an intermediate buffer, then convert it to html/xml, and
	  finally copy everything into a malloc'ed buffer because that's
	  what the generic_http_callback interface expects.

	* main/utils.c: some simplifications to
	  ast_dynamic_str_thread_build_va_couldnt_we_choose_a_shorter_name()
	  I am unsure whether the truncation of the string in case of a
	  failed attempt should be done unconditionally. See the XXX mark.
	  Russel, ideas ?

	* main/manager.c: do not return 500 Internal error if the AMI
	  command provides no output.

	* main/manager.c: mosty comment and documentation cleanup on
	  waitevent.

	* main/manager.c: Move the code to purge stale sessions to a
	  function, to simplify the body of the main loop of the accepting
	  thread. Rename purge_unused() to purge_events() so one knows what
	  the function does.

	* main/manager.c: Various simplifications of the code: + use a
	  wrapper around ast_carefulwrite(), used in two places, to make
	  life easier when we decide to use a different interface to the
	  socket. + put an ast_verbose() message on astman_append on a case
	  that should never happen now that we use a temporary file for
	  AMI-over-HTTP sessions + document and slightly simplify
	  process_events() by removing unnecessary parentheses. + in
	  get_input(), use ast_wait_for_input() instead of poll(). We may
	  want to move to a completely non-blocking

	* main/manager.c: More informative message on invalid commands.

	* main/manager.c: another normalization of AMI vs HTTP
	  identification. Should really define a macro IS_AMI(s) so it is
	  clear what we want to do.

	* main/manager.c: always use managerid to determine whether this is
	  an AMI or HTTP session, and document it.

	* main/http.c: In the previous commit i forgot to set the
	  poll_timeout to -1, causing the http threads to do busy waiting
	  around the socket... Fix the mistake, sorry for the
	  inconvenience!

	* main/http.c: document the support for running a server on TCP/TLS
	  and opening an SSL socket. We are almost ready to make this code
	  available to other modules.

	* main/http.c, configs/http.conf.sample: add a new http.conf
	  option, sslbindaddr. Because https is more secure than http, it
	  usually makes sense to keep this service more open than the one
	  on the unencrypted port.

	* main/http.c: in the helper thread, separate the FILE * creation
	  from the actual function doing work on the socket. This is
	  another generalization to provide a generic mechanism to open
	  TCP/TLS socket with a thread managing the accpet and children
	  threads managing the individual sessions.

	* main/http.c: staticize a global variable and remove an unused
	  field structure.

	* main/cli.c: describe a bit the patterns that you can have in the
	  commands, and add support for wildcard (spelled as '%'). On
	  passing fix a bug in the expansion code which was hidden and
	  appeared when implementing the wildcard The fix is just the line
	  'src != argindex', in case someone wants to test this on 1.4 -
	  but i would just keep this in trunk.

	* main/cli.c: merge the implemenmtation of "core set debug" and
	  "core set verbose". No externally visible changes.

	* channels/chan_oss.c: remove an unused function

	* channels/chan_oss.c: use the regexp cli support on some of the
	  command

	* include/asterisk/cli.h, main/cli.c: introduce a bit of regexp
	  support in the internal CLI api. Now you can specify a cli
	  command as "console autoanswer [on|off]" which means the on|off
	  argument is optional, or "console {mute|unmute}" which means the
	  mute|unmute argument is mandatory. The blocks in [] or {} do not
	  necessarily need to be at the end of the string. Completions for
	  the variant parts are generated automatically. This should
	  significantly simplify the implementation of the various
	  handlers.

	* channels/chan_oss.c: fix indentation

	* main/cli.c: new-style "core show channels"

	* main/cli.c: more changes to new style of "module load" and
	  "load". Under FreeBSD, the filename_completion used in the above
	  commands does not work. Not sure why, but on passing i note that
	  the function is part of readline and is not reentrant, so it
	  needs to be fixed one way or another.

	* main/cli.c: move another deprecated command to the new style

	* main/cli.c: move "core set debug" to the new style, and remove
	  duplicated code for the deprecated handler. On passing fix a long
	  standing bug in find_cli() which would not find the longest match
	  - this part (trivial, basically just update matchlen on a match)

	  unload and reload, and remove some unused functions. usual
	  completion fixes (as these function accept multiple arguments).
	  The summary is still a bit inconsistent.

	* include/asterisk/cli.h, main/cli.c: update the internal cli api
	  following comments from kevin. This change basically simplifies
	  the interface of the new-style handler removing almost all the
	  tricks used in the previous implementation to achieve backward
	  compatibility (which is still present and guaranteed.)

2006-11-14 16:09 +0000 [r47606-47609]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/cli.c: new-style for 'core show uptime', include 'complete'
	  support and better error checking

	* main/cli.c: apply previous fix to old-style cli entries as well.

	* main/cli.c: fix "core set debug atleast ", and fix the simple
	  case where a command can have multiple completions, the first
	  ones coming from keywords in previous CLI entries. There is no
	  solution yet for the complex case of N1 completions from a CLI
	  entry, followed by N2 from the next one, and so on, because the
	  _complete() handlers do not tell us how many matches it
	  generates, so we don't know how many to skip when interrogating
	  the other handlers. The only solution is to avoid, as much as
	  possible, multiple CLI entries with the same prefix.

	* include/asterisk/cli.h, main/cli.c: Bring in the improved
	  internal API for the CLI. WATCH OUT: this changes the binary
	  interface (ABI) for modules, so e.g. users of g729 codecs need a
	  rebuilt module (but read below). The new way to write CLI
	  handlers is described in detail in cli.h, and there are a few
	  converted handlers in cli.c, look for NEW_CLI. After converting a
	  couple of commands i am convinced that it is reasonably
	  convenient to use, and it makes it easier to fix the pending CLI
	  issues. On passing, note a bug with the current 'complete'
	  architecture: if a command is a prefix of multiple CLI entries,
	  we miss some of the possible options. As an example, "core set
	  debug" can continue with "channel" from one CLI entry, and "off"
	  or "atleast" from another one. We address this problem in a
	  separate commit (when i have figured out a fix, that is). ABI
	  issues: I asked Kevin if it was ok to make this change and he
	  said yes. While it would have been possible to make the change
	  without breaking the module ABI, the code would have been more
	  convoluted. I am happy to restore the old ABI (while still being
	  able to use the "new style" handlers) if there is demand.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: merge from team/rizzo/astobj2 rev.47246 Same

	* channels/chan_sip.c: merge from team/rizzo/astobj2, rev 47243,
	  47244, 47245: Replace ASTOBJ_UNREF(peer, sip_destroy_peer) with
	  unref_peer(peer); This places the name of the destructor in one
	  place only (where it should be), eliminates the chance of errors
	  in case you specify the wrong destructor, and also lets the

	* apps/app_dial.c: fix indentation of a block, and do minor
	  simplifications at the end of another one.

	* apps/app_dial.c: complete previous commit.

	* apps/app_dial.c: move another block into a function. On passing,
	  avoid two null-pointer string dereference while printing messages
	  (which are sometimes not fatal in some platforms, but still
	  wrong). These two lines at least should be merged to 1.4 once i
	  am done with all the changes here.

	* apps/app_dial.c: move a large block into a separate function.
	  Mark with XXX a possible bug in previous code which used the
	  wrong source in case of a forwarded call. the function
	  do_forward() needs to be split further, as the initial part is
	  replicated in another places (with some minor differences, most

	  introduce a macro, S_REPLACE, that replaces a string possibly
	  freeing the previous value. In one of these places (see the

	  a sequence number and the info where they have been generated
	  e.g. SequenceNumber: 10 File: chan_sip.c Line: 11927 Func:
	  handle_response_register It is not worthwhile having this as a

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Change name of
	  "contact" setting to "callback" which better reflects what it is
	  to the person that configures asterisk. That we use it internally
	  in the contact header is a totally different story. Still not
	  convinced this is a good option.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Globals need the "global_" prefix in
	  chan_sip, and need to be reset to default value at reload.

	  severe problems, it might help with some locking issues in

2006-10-23 21:46 +0000 [r46003-46045]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Unlike ast_strdup(), ast_strdupa() does not
	  take a NULL pointer as argument, so fix the places where this
	  might happen. This is also a fix that ought to go into 1.4 [The
	  difference between the two functions is a bit confusing, and in
	  asterisk i believe all string handling functions should be able
	  to handl a NULL string as argument, but changing the API in trunk
	  and not in 1.4 would make backporting harder.]

	* channels/chan_sip.c: remove a useless check for ocseq = 0. As
	  discussed on the mailing lists, 0 is a legal value for Cseq, so
	  there is no point to treat it specially.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: get_header() always returns a non-NULL
	  value, so checking for NULL is certainly wrong and usually
	  disables the checks that we want to make instead. This commit
	  fixes a number of the above bugs where the result of get_header()
	  is immediately checked for NULL. This is certainly a candidate
	  for merging into 1.4

	* channels/chan_sip.c: put another duplicated block of code in a
	  function.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: reformat a statement and comment a
	  potentially wrong assignement (altering state on an unvalidated
	  message).

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove unnecessary casts from const char *
	  to char *, if necessary by slightly rearranging the code.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: another use for parse_uri(). On passing,
	  remove a wrong comment (that probably I wrote myself!) and
	  introduce a temporary variable to avoid a misleading cast.

2006-10-23 16:54 +0000 [r45945-45989]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/utils.c: use autodetected support for gethostbyname_r

	* channels/chan_sip.c: + make sure parse_uri never returns NULL
	  pointers - this simplifies its usage. + add another client for
	  parse_uri, in handling Contact: strings (on passing, document the
	  content of the "fullcontact" field); + in register_verify(), mark
	  with XXX what i believe is another misinterpretation on the URI
	  format when '@' is missing. No code changed here, so no fixes
	  applied.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: After reading better the SIP RFC on sip URI
	  (19.1.1) fix parse_uri() to interpret a missing userinfo section
	  as a domain-only URI, and comment a wrong interpretation of the
	  above in check_user_full(). The function has been patched to
	  preserve the existing behaviour (in what admittedly is a corner
	  case, but could be received under attacks). Hopefully the From:
	  based matching will go away soon!

	* channels/chan_sip.c: in function get_also_info(), move argument
	  stripping before splitting around the @, otherwise the
	  refer_to_domain might contain arguments as well, causing
	  failures. I think this is a true bug that ought to be fixed in
	  1.4 as well.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: start putting the URI parsing code in one
	  place, introducing the function parse_uri() that splits a URI in
	  its components. Right now use it only in one place, because the
	  custom parsing that is done here and there sometimes has bugs
	  that i want to figure out first.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: put common code in function terminate_uri()
	  so we need to fix it only in one place.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: More cleanup of check_user_full with no
	  functional change apart from a small (but disabled by default)
	  new option. In detail: + introduce a new value for enum
	  check_auth_result, AUTH_DONT_KNOW, used (read below) when a
	  function does not have a conclusive response. Possibly this is
	  the same as AUTH_NOT_FOUND, but need to check further. + move the
	  large blocks (checking in the users list and in the peers list,
	  respectively) from check_user_full() to separate functions. They
	  return AUTH_DONT_KNOW in case they don't find a match, so the
	  caller know that it has to try the next method. There is still
	  some duplication of code here, but i have not tried yet to remove
	  it. + [new option] a new option in sip.conf, match_auth_username,
	  has been introduced, and disabled by default. If set, and the
	  incoming request carries authentication info, the username to
	  match in the users list is taken from there rather than from the
	  From: field. This change is easy to identify, being made of - one
	  line to declare the variable match_auth_username - a block of 15
	  lines in check_user_full() - one line in sip list settings - two
	  lines for parsing the config file. check_user_full() is now a lot
	  cleaner - basically a sequence of checks that are applied to the
	  request. This will help future work with new matching schemes.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: more streamlining of check_user_full

	* channels/chan_sip.c: simplify the flow of function
	  check_user_full() A large block needs reindentation now, but we
	  don't do that because it can be moved to a separate function.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: put duplicated code in functions.

	* configure, include/asterisk/autoconfig.h.in: regenerate the
	  configure script and autoconfig.h.in to reflect recent changes
	  for https support for the built in http server

2006-10-22 19:09 +0000 [r45858-45892]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/Makefile, configure.ac, main/http.c,
	  configs/http.conf.sample: Fix a few issues in the previous
	  (disabled) HTTPS code, and support linux as well (using
	  fopencookie(), which should be available in glibc). Update
	  configure.ac to check for funopen (BSD) and fopencookie(glibc),
	  and while we are at it also for gethostbyname_r (the generated
	  files need to be updated, or you need to run bootstrap.sh
	  yourself). Document the new options in http.conf.sample (names
	  are only tentative, better ones are welcome). At this point we
	  can safely enable the option. Anyone willing to try this on Sun
	  and Apple platforms ?

	* main/http.c: Implement https support. The changes are not large.
	  Most of the diff comes from putting the global variables
	  describing an accept session into a structure, so we can reuse
	  the existing code for running multiple accept threads on
	  different ports. Once this is done, and if your system has the
	  funopen() library function (and ssl, of course), it is just a
	  matter of calling the appropriate functions to set up the ssl
	  connection on the existing socket, and everything works on the
	  secure channel now. At the moment, the code is disabled because i
	  have not implemented yet the autoconf code to detect the presence
	  of funopen(), and add -lssl to main/Makefile if ssl libraries are
	  present. And a bit of documentation on the http.conf arguments,
	  too. If you want to manually enable https support, that is very
	  simple (step 0 1 2 will be eventually detected by ./configure,
	  the rest is something you will have to do anyways). 0. make sure
	  your system has funopen(3). FreeBSD does, linux probably does
	  too, not sure about other systems. 1. uncomment the following
	  line in main/http.c // #define DO_SSL /* comment in/out if you
	  want to support ssl */ 2. add -lssl to AST_LIBS in main/Makefile
	  3. add the following options to http.conf sslenable=yes
	  sslbindport=4433 ; pick one you like sslcert=/tmp/foo.pem ; path
	  to your certificate file. 4. generate a suitable certificate e.g.
	  (example from mini_httpd's Makefile: openssl req -new -x509 -days
	  365 -nodes -out /tmp/foo.pem -keyout /tmp/foo.pem and here you
	  go: https://localhost:4433/asterisk/manager now works.

	* main/http.c: it is useless and possibly wrong to use ast_cli() to
	  send the reply back to http clients. Use fprintf/fwrite instead,
	  since we are already using a FILE * to read the input. If you
	  wonder why, this is because it makes it trivial to implement
	  https support (as long as your system has funopen()). And this is
	  what i am going to put in with the next few commits...

	* channels/chan_sip.c: introduce sip_pvt_lock() and
	  sip_pvt_unlock() wrappers to lock these data structures. This
	  improve readability, and also hides the underlying locking
	  mechanism so it is a lot easier to add diagnostic code, or move
	  the object locks somewhere else, etc. On passing, rename the lock
	  field in sip_pvt to pvt_lock, also for ease of readability.

	* main/manager.c: minor comment changes, code rearrangement and
	  field renaming to minimize diffs with future modifications. The
	  current implementation is problematic for the following reasons:
	  + all insertions are O(N) because the event list does not have a
	  tail pointer; + there is only a single lock protecting both
	  session and users queues. + the implementation of the queue
	  itself is not documented. I think i have figured it out, more or
	  less, but am unclear on whether there is proper locking in place
	  The rewrite (which i have working locally) uses a tailq so
	  insertions are O(1), separate locks for the event and session
	  queues, and has a documented implementation so hopefully we can
	  figure out if/where bug exist.

	* main/manager.c: another bunch of comments on the data structures.

	* main/manager.c: despite the large changes, this commit only moves
	  functions around so that functions belonging to the same group
	  are close to each other. At the beginning of each group i have
	  added a bit of documentation to explain what the group does and
	  what is the typical flow - basically, all i have learned by code
	  inspection over the past few days should be documented for you to
	  read. I have not put many doxygen annotations just because i am
	  not sure what are the proper ones. Hopefully some doxygen experts
	  will jump in. Next on the plate: try to figure out how "struct
	  eventqent" are supposed to work.

	* main/manager.c: more comment and formatting fixes, small
	  simplifications to functions get_input() and session_do()

	* main/manager.c: rizzo compile then commit, maybe even run it too
	  ^_^

2006-10-18 15:49 +0000 [r45529-45561]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/manager.c: comment and cleanup the main thread. On passing,
	  fix a bug: close the socket if the allocation of a structure for
	  the new session fails. (the bugfix is a candidate for 1.4)

	* main/manager.c: create a new (internal, for the time being)
	  function astman_start_ack() to start manager responses that need
	  further lines. This removes a lot of duplicate code from the
	  various handlers that at the moment build an ActionID string
	  themselves. Once settled, the function should move to manager.h
	  so it can be used by other files (chan_agent, chan_iax2,
	  chan_sip, chan_zap, res_jabber and app_queue). I am not totally
	  clear if there is a preferred position for the ActionID: line in
	  a message. Some instances put it at the end, but one would argue
	  that it is preferable to have it at the beginning.

	* main/manager.c: more indentation cleanup from previous commits,
	  and remove the "busy" field from struct mansession as it was not
	  used correctly anyways.

	* main/manager.c: create proper handlers for "Challenge" and
	  "Login" actions, rather than use inline code for them. Things are
	  more readable this way, and also error processing is more
	  consistent.

	* main/manager.c: fix indentation from a commit of a couple of days
	  ago

	* main/manager.c: another batch of simplifications to
	  authenticate() (they are committed a bit at a time so it is
	  easier to revert them in case we find a bug at a later time).

	* /, channels/chan_sip.c: Remove duplicate declarations...

2006-10-18 11:59 +0000 [r45463-45518]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/manager.c, configs/manager.conf.sample: remove unused fields
	  and unimplemented options.

	* main/manager.c: first pass as simplifying authenticate(),
	  avoiding whitespace changes

	* main/manager.c: more code simplifications

	* main/manager.c: simplify ast_strings_to_mask

	* main/manager.c: add a comment to remember that a block of code is
	  completely redundant.

	* main/manager.c: + move the enum declaration for output formats
	  near the head of the file, so it can be used from more places; +
	  make the declaration of contenttype[] more robust; + remove the
	  wrappers around __xml_translate(), since they were used only in
	  one place, and rename to xml_translate(). This allows for a bit
	  of simplifications. + document the output produced by the above
	  function.

	* main/manager.c: merge xml_translate() and html_translate() into
	  one function since they do similar things. Add a small form on
	  top of the html output so request like
	  http://foo:8088/asterisk/manager will suggest you what to do.
	  Note: i suspect there is still a bug somewhere in the session
	  matching code, as sometimes you have to login twice in order for
	  the following commands to be recognised. Apart from this, the cli
	  now is basically usable from a web form!

	* main/http.c: introduce uri_decode() so that '+' are translated
	  into ' ' (e.g. browsers do this when they encode input strings
	  from a form).

	* main/http.c: various code simplifications to reduce nesting
	  depth, minor optimizations to avoid extra calls of strlen(), and
	  some variable localization. One feature worth backporting is the
	  move of ast_variables_destroy() to a different place in
	  handle_uri() to avoid leaking memory in case a uri is not found.

2006-10-17 17:51 +0000 [r45334]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/manager.c: Improve the XML formatting of responses coming
	  from web interface. Normal responses are sequences of lines of
	  the form "Name: value", with \r\n as line terminators and an
	  empty line as a response terminator. Generi CLI commands,
	  however, do not have such a clean formatting, and the existing
	  code failed to generate valid XML for them. Obviously we can only
	  use heuristics here, and we do the following: - accept either \r
	  or \n as a line terminator, trimming trailing whitespace; - if a
	  line does not have a ":" in it, assume that from this point on we
	  have unformatted data, and use "Opaque-data:" as a name; - if a
	  line does have a ":" in it, the Name field is not always a legal
	  identifier, so replace non-alphanum characters with underscores;
	  All the above is to be refined as we improve the formatting of
	  responses from the CLI. And, all the above ought to go as a
	  comment in the code rather than just in a commit message...

2006-10-17 17:41 +0000 [r45330]  Luigi Rizzo <rizzo@icir.org>

	* main/manager.c: open a temporary file to receive the output from
	  cli commands invoked through the http interface. It is not
	  terribly efficient but better than no output at all. Todo: use a
	  configurable /tmp directory instead of a hardwired one.

	  originating channel. (BE-85)

	  localize one variable and minor code simplifications.

	* main/manager.c: protect access to first_action with actionlock.
	  Mark with XXX one place (during command execution) where
	  navigation should be protected with actionlock, but is not
	  because it would block requests for a long time. To solve this
	  properly we need to put reference counts in the struct
	  manager_action. A suboptimal fix is to copy the record on a
	  search and then unlock the list while we work on the copy.

	* main/http.c: comment some functions, and more small code
	  simplifications

	* main/http.c: fix indentation of a large block after changes in
	  previous commit (basically whitespace only).

	* main/http.c: simplify string parsing routines using ast_skip_*()

	* main/http.c: don't forget to close a descriptor on a malloc

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Try to avoid the use of 'z' modifier in
	  cases where it is not necessary - rather, cast the argument to
	  int. In this case, the string is in a UDP packet and as such
	  limited to 64k so its length can be safely represented in an int
	  without truncation (besides, this is just a debugging message!)

	* channels/chan_sip.c: arguments to auth_headers() needed to be
	  swapped here. To avoid the same mistake in the future (due to
	  slightly confusing variable names), add a comment. On passing,
	  remove a redundant initialization.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: slightly restructure the code that computes
	  the channel's name

	* channels/chan_sip.c: put repeated code to set nat mode in a
	  function.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: put common code in a function to avoid
	  repetitions.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: remove hardwired usage of 5060, use
	  DEFAULT_SIP_PORT instead

	* channels/chan_sip.c: improve and document function
	  get_in_brackets(), introducing a helper function
	  find_closing_quote() of more general use.

	* channels/chan_sip.c: when possible, use ast_set2_flags instead of
	  ast_set/ast_clr . Also mark XXX some dubious places.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: document a bit the use of templates.
	  They are highly convenient for writing configuration files,
	  especially if you have many similar entries, or want to switch
	  quickly between different configurations without having to
	  comment/uncomment large sections of the files.

	* configs/sip.conf.sample: document the "contact" option a bit
	  better.

	* res/res_limit.c: help old bsd-system which don't have RLIMIT_AS
	  and use RLIMIT_VMEM for virtual memory limits.

	* main/manager.c, main/http.c: make sure sockets are blocking when
	  they should be blocking.

	* channels/chan_sip.c, configs/sip.conf.sample: Two things: 1.
	  slightly rearrange/simplify the parsing of the argument in
	  sip_register. This brings in a patch that has been in Mantis
	  (5834) for ages, and is the larger part of the commit; 2.
	  implement the "contact" option for peers, similar to the one in
	  users.conf: If you put a "contact" option with a non-empty
	  argument (e.g. contact=123) in a peer section, asterisk will
	  register with the provider as if you had a register=
	  username:secret@host/contact line in the general section. The
	  latter is a very small is a new feature so i am not putting it in
	  the 1.4 branch, although the "contact" option in user.conf is
	  already in the 1.4 branch and so it wouldn't be too strange to
	  merge it. Note that the implementation of "contact" is much
	  simpler than the one in 5834, and limited to a few lines in
	  build_peer().

2006-10-06 09:01 +0000 [r44545]  Olle Johansson <oej@edvina.net>

	* channels/chan_sip.c: Remove deprecated "incominglimit" config

	* pbx/pbx_ael.c: These mods fix a problem pointed out by dgartang,
	  where in certain situations, the target of a goto cannot be
	  found, even right under your nose. This is because the current
	  context is not updated properly, and rather than waste time and
	  find why and where the context should have been updated, I just
	  use my newly added 'dad' ptrs, and pop until I have either the
	  context or extension, and use that instead.

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Basically, this commit only
	  simplifies configure.ac and makes the mechanism more flexible,
	  but otherwise should not affect your build even if you regenerate
	  the "configure" script. (Most likely you need to run bootstrap.sh
	  as you really need to re-run autoheader for reasons that i do not
	  completely understand). If you don't regenerate "configure", of
	  course you will see no difference. In detail: - restructure the
	  check for mandatory modules to remove some redundant code blocks;
	  - extend the AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK so that it can used also for
	  checking headers; - define the AST_C_DEFINE_CHECK macro to test
	  for #defined symbols; - for the two above macros, add a last
	  argument that getscopied into HAVE_$1_VERSION so the source can
	  adapt to different versions of the same libraries/header/etc -
	  document the above; - document a problem that existed before and
	  i did not manage to solve: the 'description' argument to
	  AC_DEFINE does not substiture shell variables so you will not see
	  the actual values in the comments (in autoconfig.h)..

	* configure.ac: simplify checks for OSS using AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK;
	  remove two repeated blocks using better logic.

	* acinclude.m4: small formatting fix

	* acinclude.m4: when only checking headers, do not set $1_LIB. Also
	  PBX_$1=0 is the default so we don't need to set it explicitly.

	* acinclude.m4: document, and extend a bit the macro
	  AST_EXT_LIB_CHECK so that it can be used in more places in
	  configure.ac

	* configure.ac: restore proper CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for FreeBSD,
	  until a better solution is found. Please do not commit the
	  regenerated "configure" file yet, as there are some more
	  simplifications to be applied to configure.ac and acinclude.m4 in
	  the next few days. For the same reason, i am postponing the
	  commit to the 1.4 branch until the above changes are complete.

	* utils/Makefile: correct libraries for astman, at least so i
	  think...

	* Makefile: put linker flags in ASTLDFLAGS where they belong

	* Makefile, main/Makefile, codecs/lpc10/Makefile: merge compile
	  fixes from 44080: - with AST_DEVMODE, building codecs/lpc10 fails
	  because of lots of warnings, and the configure step in editline
	  fails as well. Fix this by removing the -Werror in these steps. -
	  on FreeBSD (but probably on other platforms as well), the final
	  link of asterisk fails because AST_LIBS was not exported to the
	  subdirs Makefiles. Add a proper fix in the top-level Makefile (a
	  possible alternative way is to add "export AST_LIBS" near the
	  beginning of the file). With this fix, i believe that some of the
	  platform-specific conditionals in main/Makefile are redundant
	  (because they should be already dealt with in the top level
	  Makefile) but i don't have a platform to check.

	  Sep 2006) | 42 lines Fix a problem that occurred if a user
	  entered a digit that matched a bridge feature that was configured
	  using multiple digits, and the digit that was pressed timed out
	  in the feature digit timeout period. For example, if blind
	  transfer is configured as '##', and a user presses just '#'. In
	  this situation, the call would lock up and no longer pass any
	  frames. (issue #7977 reported by festr, and issue #7982 reported
	  by michaels and valuable input provided by mneuhauser and kuj.
	  Fixed by me, with testing help and peer review from Joshua Colp).
	  There are a couple of issues involved in this fix: 1) When
	  ast_generic_bridge determines that there has been a timeout, it
	  returned AST_BRIDGE_RETRY. Then, when ast_channel_bridge gets
	  this result, it calls ast_generic_bridge over again with the same
	  timestamp for the next event. This results in an endless loop of
	  nothing until the call is terminated. This is resolved by simply
	  changing ast_generic_bridge to return AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE when it
	  sees a timeout. 2) I also changed ast_channel_bridge such that if
	  in the process of calculating the time until the next event, it
	  knows a timeout has already occured, to immediately return
	  AST_BRIDGE_COMPLETE instead of attempting to bridge the channels
	  anyway. 3) In the process of testing the previous two changes, I
	  ran into a problem in res_features where ast_channel_bridge would
	  return because it determined that there was a timeout. However,
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features would then determine by its own
	  calculation that there was still 1 ms before the timeout really
	  occurs. It would then proceed, and since the bridge broke out and
	  did *not* return a frame, it interpreted this as the call was
	  over and hung up the channels. The reason for this was because
	  ast_bridge_call in res_features and ast_channel_bridge in
	  channel.c were using different times for their calculations.
	  channel.c uses the start_time on the bridge config, which is the
	  time that the feature digit was recieved. However, res_features
	  had another time, 'start', which was set right before calling
	  ast_channel_bridge. 'start' will always be slightly after
	  start_time in the bridge config, and sometimes enough to round up
	  to one ms. This is fixed by making ast_bridge_call use the same
	  time as ast_channel_bridge for the timeout calculation. ........
